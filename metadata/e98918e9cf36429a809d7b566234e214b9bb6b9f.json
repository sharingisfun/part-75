The Shocking Beheaded Samurai Appears!&quot;\n\nSynopsis:\n Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, and Robin are standing near the dead dragon that Zoro killed, with Luffy trying to pull out the man who is stuck in the dragon's nose. Luffy succeeds by pulling out only the legs, making everyone think that he killed the man. However, the legs are alive and they run away trying to look for a Shichibukai. Luffy runs after him and gets stuck to the legs after the legs fall on top of him. Elsewhere, the Straw Hats who were captured by the people in the hazmat suits (Sanji, Nami, Chopper, and Franky) are in a prison cell and were shown to a gaseous figure known as &quot;Master&quot; who is very interested in Franky. They wake up minutes later in a cell and try to figure out how to get out. They then see a man's head which was cut into pieces and put it together. The head is alive and it tells them that his body was cut into pieces by a Shichibukai and he feels shameful for not getting killed after getting sliced. Back with Luffy's group, Usopp sees a harpy girl on top of a burned down building,but after he yells for everyone to look, she disappears suddenly. They then approach a lake that separates the fiery and icy halves of Punk Hazard. Luffy befriends a centaur that thought that Luffy was one of his kind. The people of Punk Hazard who work for Master see Luffy's group and tell the harpy girl about them.\n\nVideo: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC, 23fps\nQuality: 480p (848x480)\n\nAudio: Vorbis Audio 44kHz\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5811_zps272bdf32.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5811_zps272bdf32.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op581_zps8ec29422.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op581_zps8ec29422.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5812_zpsda352f13.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5812_zpsda352f13.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5813_zps51b8f7d4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5813_zps51b8f7d4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5815_zps3d022206.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5815_zps3d022206.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5814_zps203e8c67.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5814_zps203e8c67.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5816_zpsc9011400.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o644/SparklingVega/One%20Piece%20581/op5816_zpsc9011400.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98918e9cf36429a809d7b566234e214b9bb6b9f","amp;dn":"%5BVega004%5D+One+Piece+-+581+%5B480p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98918e9cf36429a809d7b566234e214b9bb6b9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,137,24,233,207,54,66,154,128,157,123,86,98,52,226,20,185,187,107,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
