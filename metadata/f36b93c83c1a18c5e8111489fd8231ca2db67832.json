They're loving, fun and a little crazy. In other words, just like everyone else - with one exception: they live in a very special house. The White House!\n\nWhether it's entertaining foreign dignitaries, holding secret cabinet meetings, or putting out fires - figuratively and sometimes literally - there's never a dull moment in the Gilchrist White House. For example, the First Son (Josh Gad, star of Broadway sensation &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;) is one of the administration's biggest liabilities but also the glue that holds this family together. The President (Bill Pullman) knows too well that the only thing harder than being Head of State is being head of the family.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f36b93c83c1a18c5e8111489fd8231ca2db67832","amp;dn":"1600.Penn.S01E04.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f36b93c83c1a18c5e8111489fd8231ca2db67832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,107,147,200,60,26,24,197,232,17,20,137,253,130,49,202,45,182,120,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
