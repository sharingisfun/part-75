A.T.'s Delight is the only album made under his own name for the label and it is a remarkable one. Choosing great compositions by Coltrane, Monk, Denzil Best and Kenny Dorham, Taylor assembled a great quintet fronted by Dave Burns and Stanley Turrentine, often adding Potato's congas to the proceedings. The unique and varied arrangements and great playing pay tribute to the drummer's exceptional song selection.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01. Syeeda's Song Flute\n02. Epistrophy\n03. Move\n04. High Seas\n05. Cookoo and Fungi\n06. Blue Interlude\n\nPersonnel: Art Taylor (drums); Stanley Turrentine (tenor saxophone); Dave Burns (trumpet); Wynton Kelly (piano); Paul Chambers (bass instrument); Carlos &quot;Patato&quot; Valdes (congas).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec9d4091eeb6173ae7551930d2bb51d360c24ebf","amp;dn":"Art+Taylor+-+A.T.%27s+Delight+%5B1960%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec9d4091eeb6173ae7551930d2bb51d360c24ebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,157,64,145,238,182,23,58,231,85,25,48,210,187,81,211,96,194,78,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
