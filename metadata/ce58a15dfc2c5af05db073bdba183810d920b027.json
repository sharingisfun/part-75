(I believe it is Russian.) With one blast, the pattern is laid in? the corresponding conductive nuclei over Greenland and escorted eastward with several TTA's in the area working in concert. The sonic undulation patterns are profound. And the single sonic blast over Greenland is visualized on another map creating images, like metals on a sheet above a carved magnet.\n\nThe Weather Channel shows icy chemcloud sculptures in the sky\nthat span entire nations.  More images than were presented here. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.weatherchannel.com.au/WeatherMap&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.weatherchannel.com.au/WeatherMap&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThough not pointed out in the video, multi-directional sonic undulation is visible throughout the images.  It has begun my friends on a massive scale!\n\nAND SO IT BEGINS...\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nHoles in Heaven -  HAARP and Advances in Tesla Technology:\nThe late Carl Sagan said (which is related to this documentary): WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also arranged things so that almost no one understands science or technology. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later, this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces. This documentary film poses the question: Are we making Holes in Heaven? HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) is a controversial high frequency radio transmitter, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“ionospheric heater,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is believed to be descended from the works of Nikola Tesla and is operated by the U.S. Navy/Air Force and Phillip Laboratories in remote Gakona, Alaska.\n\n\nEphesians 5:11\n\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n\n   \n       \n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS    \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce58a15dfc2c5af05db073bdba183810d920b027","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Wars+and+Rumors+of+Wars+-+21+-+Secret+Scalar+Wars+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce58a15dfc2c5af05db073bdba183810d920b027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,88,161,93,252,44,90,240,93,176,115,189,186,24,56,16,217,32,176,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
