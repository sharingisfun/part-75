Many people are\nswitching to Auction Auto Bidder after trying the others, make\nthe right choice now and save your money. With the 60 day\nsatisfaction guarantee, you have nothing to loose.\n\nWhy snipe (bid in the last seconds) rather than use eBay's\nproxy-bidding?\n\nWin items at a lower cost since no one will have time to outbid\nyou, if you bid a long time before the end, eBay will email the\nprevious high bidder to let them know they've been outbid so\nthey will most likely come back and outbid you causing the\nprice to increase, this software prevents this and often pays\nfor itself on the first use \nIncrease your chances of winning since people wont have time to\noutbid you \nYou can decide to remove your bid up to the last minute since\nit is only sent to eBay in the last seconds\n\nAlso works as a fully featured web browser optimized to make\nbrowsing eBay faster &amp; easier.\n\nWhat are bid groups?\n\nWith bid groups, you can find several listings of an item you\nwant, add them all to be sniped and place them in a group.

By doing this, the software will\nattempt to win the first one at your lowest bid, if it wins, all\nother bids in the group are canceled, if you're outbid, it will\ntry to win the second one and so on.
