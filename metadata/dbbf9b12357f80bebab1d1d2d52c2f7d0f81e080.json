Husbands and Wives\n\nCool Cats\nBy Eric Webb\n\nQuick, compare your favorite musicians to types of food. For example: the Foo Fighters are a steak, so rock-solid are they. Janis Joplin is a bowl of grits, obviously. Bon Iver is a delightful, warm chowder of some sort. Perhaps clam.\n\nMiniature Tigers is Cool Whip.\n\nOn the Brooklyn indie pop bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third album, the smirkingly titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mia Pharaoh,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the name of the game is light and airy with a flavor that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be beat. Miniature Tigers is a prime example of the synth-heavy dream pop sound that Ã¢â‚¬Å“all those crazy kidsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are listening to these days. In fact, you could make a mix tape of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mia PharaohÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Neon Indian songs, blast it through some speakers and have yourself a very effective trap for V-neck shirts and girls with bangs. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d get snared.\n\nAnd before diving into the songs, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reflect on the album title, because this Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ this is Shakespeare, man.\n\nThe opening salvo, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex On the Regular,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is brimming with energetic cheesiness, best listened to with a pencil-thin mustache creeping up onto your upper lip. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little Miike Snow, a little Discovery. Like fellow synthsmiths Chromeo, Miniature Tigers capitalize on a brand of pseudo-parody cool that many let go of two decades ago and repurpose it for a good time. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the business model of American Apparel, actually.\n\nAnd that, in some part, is the point: This is not a new style. In many ways, the faux-80s workout video aesthetic is skateboarding and jazzercizing its way out the door faster than Patrick Bateman running down the stairs with a chainsaw. Of course, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s South By Southwest in Austin right now, so maybe IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m projecting.\n\nTracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Female DoctorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Easy As All ThatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are perfectly Ã¢â‚¬Å“on messageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with the refurbished neon nightscapes that Miniature Tigers deals in, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the right kind of winking sleaziness. Ã¢â‚¬Å“BoomerangÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angel BathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ both take a little 1950s time warp in moments. I thought I was listening to a Waffle House jukebox for a second. But that embellishment is just a springboard in both cases: Ã¢â‚¬Å“BoomerangÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ blends into the rest of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mia PharaohÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ pretty quickly, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angel BathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ turns into a David Lynch movie. There is a spooky, angelic backing track that, joined by a horror movie spoken word breakdown and a feedback distortion effect, is essentially a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue VelvetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tribute song. And how appropriate: LynchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film gives the 1960s a love letter, and Miniature Tigers is making out with the 1980s.\n\nMore ethereal tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“CleopatraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flower DoorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are dreamy and smooth, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Afternoons with David HockneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a personal favorite that sounds like Dan Black at his most contemplative. Tying the whole package together? The atypical Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hologram Girl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an acoustic ballad with faraway sadness that is this close to making the rest of the album look a little cheap. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tailored coat in thrift store full of (albeit fun and charming) windbreakers.\n\nFull disclosure: I am trying so hard to write around using the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“hipsterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in this review. This writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s internal thesaurus has run out of pages. Miniature Tigers makes music soaked in Pabst Blue Ribbon. Call it indie, call it whatever, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what it is. And it is a fine example of it. Separate yourself from the associations you have about a promotional mix CD from Urban Outfitters, and hear me out.\n\nMaybe there is a dose of irony in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mia Pharaoh.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an unstoppable, all-consuming, nigh insatiable wildfire of irony. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care, and no one should. I listen to music because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good and because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mia PharaohÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is golden in my book\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbbf9b12357f80bebab1d1d2d52c2f7d0f81e080","amp;dn":"Miniature+Tigers+-+Mia+Pharaoh+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbbf9b12357f80bebab1d1d2d52c2f7d0f81e080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,191,155,18,53,127,128,190,186,177,209,210,213,44,47,125,15,129,224,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
