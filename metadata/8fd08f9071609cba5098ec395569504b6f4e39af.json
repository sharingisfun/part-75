This farmer's son started studying Geology and was destined for a career in the petroleum industry before his rise to stardom. Idir has been the ambassador of the Kabyle culture, especially the Kabyle music, with only his vocals and acoustic guitar. Idir has always used his status to claim his Berber (Amazigh) identity. His first album A Vava Inouva came out in 1976, and the song &quot;A Vava Inouva&quot; was translated into seven languages. After notable success, Idir wrote and recorded his second album Ay Arrac Negh (meaning To our children) in 1979.\n\nIdir restarted his career again with the release of a compilation in 1991 of seventeen songs from his first two albums &quot;A Vava Inouva&quot; and &quot;Ay Arrac Negh&quot;.\n\nIn 1993, a new album Les Chasseurs de lumiÃƒÂ¨res (meaning the hunters of lights) appeared on the Blue Silver label. &quot;Les Chasseurs de lumiÃƒÂ¨res&quot; is about (his) predilection, love, freedom and exile (which he had known since he moved to the Paris region in 1975). The acoustic guitar gives to the songs of this album a touch of modernism. We can also hear the voice of the Breton singer Alan Stivell in the duo &quot;Isaltiyen&quot;.\n\nIdir restarted his career once again with IdentitÃƒÂ©s in 1999, a tribute album which joined numerous artists together including Manu Chao, Dan Ar Braz, Maxime Le Forestier, and Karen Matheson for a &quot;A Vava Inouva 2&quot;. Also included were Gnawa Diffusion, Zebda, Gilles Servat, Geoffrey Oryema and the Orchestre National de BarbÃƒÂ¨s.\n\nIn 2008, he had a single with &quot;Tout ce temps&quot; written by Zaho. He insisted that she joins in for the release of the single as a duo.\n\nIdir is also the author of &quot;A tulawin&quot;, a music that has been made famous by Manu Chao's version named &quot;Denia&quot; (Poor Algeria), in his album PrÃƒÂ³xima EstaciÃƒÂ³n: Esperanza.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd08f9071609cba5098ec395569504b6f4e39af","amp;dn":"IDIR+-+Adrar+Inu+%282013%29+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd08f9071609cba5098ec395569504b6f4e39af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,208,143,144,113,96,156,186,80,152,236,57,85,105,80,75,111,78,57,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
