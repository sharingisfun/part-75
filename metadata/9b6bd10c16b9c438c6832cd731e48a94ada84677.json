Also the decompression speed of CAERA is considerably higher.\n\n\nCAERA can be effectively used to transfer CAE studies via Internet, storing the results and operating them both on desktop and the cloud\n\nÃÂ¡urrent release is designed to work with Siemens Femap. For instalation use &quot;instal.bat&quot; from the Torrents\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b6bd10c16b9c438c6832cd731e48a94ada84677","amp;dn":"%5BTMMiSAPR%5D+CAE+Result+Archiver+v1.1.5+%28CAEra%29+for+FEMAP+x86+x64+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b6bd10c16b9c438c6832cd731e48a94ada84677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,107,209,12,22,185,196,56,198,131,44,215,49,228,138,148,173,168,70,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
