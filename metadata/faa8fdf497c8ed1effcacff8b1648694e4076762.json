Perker\n\nThis series, a collision of comedy, sex, and violence, follows the misadventures of America's most dysfunctional family as they go head-to-severed head with an Oprah-loving ax murderer, a cult-crazy soap opera star, and a neo-Nazi prison gang.\nFirst issue: Todd wants desperately to make friends, but every kid he approaches winds up decapitated. Or worse. Meanwhile, Todd's mother is on a mission to get even with her husband who she believes is having an affair.\n\nenjoy &amp; seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa8fdf497c8ed1effcacff8b1648694e4076762","amp;dn":"Todd%2C+The+Ugliest+Kid+On+Earth+01+%28of+4%29%282013%29_%28digital%29_%28Son_of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa8fdf497c8ed1effcacff8b1648694e4076762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,168,253,244,151,200,237,30,255,202,207,248,177,100,134,148,228,7,103,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
