In 1910 Canadian composer Louis-Philippe Laurendeau arranged &quot;Entrance of the Gladiators&quot; for a small band under the title &quot;Thunder and Blazes&quot;, and sold this version throughout North America. It was during this period that the song gained lasting popularity as a screamer march for circuses, often used to introduce clowns. \n\n       In 1974, writers Leo Sayer and David Courtney wove the introduction and melody into their composition, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; which became a hit for the pop group Three Dog Night.\n\n      Gwen Stefani's &quot;Don't Get It Twisted&quot; from her 2006 album &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; makes use of the theme in the song's main hook.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aa8966c751df385506e80766db33f76a79ea0c2","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+457","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aa8966c751df385506e80766db33f76a79ea0c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,168,150,108,117,29,243,133,80,110,128,118,109,179,63,118,167,158,160,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
