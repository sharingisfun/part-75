During the emergency attendance to a burned patient with Dr. Uozumi (Masanobu Takashima) and two other nurses, Dr. Akiba (KÃƒÂ´ichi SatÃƒÂ´) and the nurse commit an error, injecting sodium chlorate and killing him. Dr. Uozumi convinces the team to forge the report to save their careers. Meanwhile, an ambulance leaves a patient in the emergency with a lethal infection. When the muscles and internal organs of the patient liquefy, Dr. Kiyoshi Akai (ShirÃƒÂ´ Sano) convinces his two colleagues to examine and research the virus, leading the employees of the night shift to a tragic end.\n\n                                                                                                                                  Imdb Link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418778/\n\n                                                                                                  Technical:\n                                                                                       Language:Japanese\n                                                                           Subtitles: english hardsubbed\n                                                                                          TRT:98 minutes\n                                                                                             Genre: horror\n                                                                                            Format: MKV\n                                                                                           Size:300MB\n                                                                                       seedboxed: yes\n                                                        Downsized from mp4 format to minimkv\n            come see us in irc on the efnet server at #zombiRG and keep watching for more zombiRG uploads!\n                                              zombiRG thanks esoess and random for their support","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be8971709bebfd92be3c7354abe0e1d54126c60f","amp;dn":"Infection+HardSub-zombiRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be8971709bebfd92be3c7354abe0e1d54126c60f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,137,113,112,155,235,253,146,190,60,115,84,171,224,225,213,65,38,198,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
