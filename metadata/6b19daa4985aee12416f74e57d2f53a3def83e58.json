It provides a built-in player that allows you to select the section as you view the clip. You can use this software to convert selected part or convert a single video file. It comes with fast speed and supports a lot of popular movie formats, such as AVI, MPEG1, MPEG2 (NTSC/PAL options for DVD, VCD, SVCD), WMV, ASF and Quick Time formats. The interface is very user-friendly and easy-to-use. \ncurrently the free version, I am working on a keygen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b19daa4985aee12416f74e57d2f53a3def83e58","amp;dn":"Movie+To+gif+Converter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b19daa4985aee12416f74e57d2f53a3def83e58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,25,218,164,152,90,238,18,65,111,116,229,125,47,83,163,222,248,62,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
