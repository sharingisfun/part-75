Video/Audio are untouched. There is absolutely no point to reencode\nas the source is progressive and the file sizes are very &quot;affordable&quot;. That's also the \nreason for H264 tag and not x264. \n\n\nThe Good: Most of TV shows never see a Blu-Ray release. This is the closest thing\n          you'd get to a retail HD release. HDTV 720p caps are not regularly archived on many \n          sites and they have the all &quot;issues&quot; of a TV cap - screen spam from network, occasional\n          issues such as airing compression artifacts, encode filtering issues, no end credits\n          and so on. \n\nThe Bad: 1) Go prove you didn't just leech it off a Pee2Pee and scene'd it.\n         2) No rules\n         3) No site sections\n         4) Low tradability.\n\nBest way we thought of to work around &quot;The Bad 1)&quot; is a screenshot of our iTunes queue as it's downloading\nthe set. Seems like a decent proof we spent our hard earned money on the atrocity that is iTunes, fruit of \nthe devil's spawn (aka crApple).\n\nWhy bother? Everyone likes high res and so do we. We are aiming at shows we personally love and don't \nhave high res copies of. In this instance, Everwood S01 never had 720p caps unlikely to ever see a Blu-Ray \nrelease. In fact, even the dvds for S01 are all shitty FS (apart for the first ep which was in letterboxed WS).\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Smell. The cold smells like pine... or the pine smells like cold... something.&quot;\nAmy\n\n&quot;Uh, Dad, depending on how many people are there today, do you think I could borrow that rifle to shoot myself?&quot;\nBright\n\n&quot;Newsflash Dr Brown, you're not here to save the world. Only to annoy it.&quot;\nDr. Abbott\n\n&quot;I'd like to take a moment and point out that this is by far the weirdest restaurant we've ever been to, and we're \nfrom New York City where we're regularly served by drag queens named Frank.&quot;\nEphram","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e0ee725c8c22139017cdb7961c2785100f40fd8","amp;dn":"Everwood.S01E17.720p.WEBRip.H264-DRAWER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e0ee725c8c22139017cdb7961c2785100f40fd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,14,231,37,200,194,33,57,1,124,219,121,97,194,120,81,0,244,15,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
