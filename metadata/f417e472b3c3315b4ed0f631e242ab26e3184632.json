Fortunately, her older brother Kamiomi happens to be a teacher at the school she is supposed to attend. With the use of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brother Surveillance ToolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ she can view the outside world via her computer. Theoretically it should be helping her adjust to interfacing with people again... Instead, it's giving her an up close and personal view of the very odd Yagami sisters who have various types of Ã¢â‚¬Å“interestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Kamiomi. It looks like Sasami will have to take off her pajamas and go out into the Ã¢â‚¬Å“realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ world to set things straight in Sasami-san@Ganabaranai.\n\n\n\nRelease date : Jan 25, 2012\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\n\nGenres: comedy, romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f417e472b3c3315b4ed0f631e242ab26e3184632","amp;dn":"%5BFFF%5D+Sasami-san%40Ganbaranai+-+03+%5B787D760E%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f417e472b3c3315b4ed0f631e242ab26e3184632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,23,228,114,179,195,49,91,78,208,246,49,226,66,171,38,227,24,70,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
