Working with his considerably more emotional associate, Ellis Shafer, Wells investigates the assassinations of interrogation team members working on a group of jihadists at a secret location known as the Midnight House. Berenson switches from Wells's and Shafer's difficult and perilous search, which takes the former to and from Cairo, to a sequence of flashbacks involving the team members going about their grim job at the House. The result is a clever mix of detective story and spy thriller, with Guidall handling the chronological and genre shifts as smoothly and efficiently as he does the changes in accents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6789cea288def8f93bc29a1fc116e90ecde0af3f","amp;dn":"Alex+Berenson+-+The+Midnight+House","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6789cea288def8f93bc29a1fc116e90ecde0af3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,137,206,162,136,222,248,249,59,194,154,31,193,22,233,14,205,224,175,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
