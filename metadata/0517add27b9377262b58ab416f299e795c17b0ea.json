Accompanying him is a motley posse, including a sharp-shooting gambler whose fiancee the gang has kidnapped.\n\n\nUser Review\n\nThere's a murderous outlaw named Drago played by Morgan Woodward who keeps committing all kinds of crime in the state of Colorado and then running back to the New Mexico territory where the local sheriffs can't catch him.\n\nThat's not going to stop Audie Murphy, sheriff of Lodgepole, Colorado. Woodward's robbed a train that was carrying funds for the bank and because he's got the town nest egg, a lot of businesses will fold.\n\nMurphy puts together a posse to go after Woodward and it's some posse, with just about everybody in it working off their own agenda. There is no way Murphy should have accomplished his mission in this film.\n\nWhich is of course why Gunpoint, though entertaining, is highly unrealistic. Still a nice cast of western veterans give Murphy some good support. Particular to note are Warren Stevens as the saloon owner and Edgar Buchanan as a leader of a family of equally bad rawhiders whose camp the posse stumbles across.\n\nGunpoint has a lot of action and a great cast that make up for a highly unrealistic story.
