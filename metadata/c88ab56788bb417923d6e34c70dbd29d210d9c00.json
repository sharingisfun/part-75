When he wasn't surfing California crests, he was picking out tunes on the guitar. It's been a long ride, but he's finally released his first album, Word of Mouth, and it was worth the wait. Word of Mouth is beachy, but it's definitely not a pop album.\n\nThere's something dark in tracks like &quot;Comatose,&quot; where a violin gently weeps in the background. The songs are mostly quiet; not terribly deep or heavy, but, with the exception of a few, not descriptively bubbly. However, it is the released single from the album, called &quot;Blue Eyes,&quot; that makes Curran. That song is a marriage of country and bongo; the lyrics may not be terribly introspective, but it's a catchy track. This is definitely a summery album, and that song in particular is the middle of July on a beautiful morning. Curran, who was considered to have been a pioneer of surfing's &quot;aerial revolution&quot; during the 1990's, is still a professional on the waves, but now he's riding the stage as well. He's ripping through the Floridian coast as I type, but Word of Mouth comes out tomorrow: dip your toes in the water.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c88ab56788bb417923d6e34c70dbd29d210d9c00","amp;dn":"Timmy+Curran+-+Word+Of+Mouth+%282008%29%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c88ab56788bb417923d6e34c70dbd29d210d9c00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,138,181,103,136,187,65,121,35,214,227,76,112,219,210,157,33,13,156,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
