A Game Boy Advance adaptation was released in 2004. The GBA game was created independently of Namco, due to a licensing deal with Destination Software.\n\nAs a relatively straightforward third-person shooter, the most distinguishing characteristic of Kill Switch is its cover system, a mechanic that has the player character taking cover behind objects and around corners in a manner similar to Namco's own Time Crisis series of light gun shooters as well as Koei's third-person shooter WinBack and Konami's stealth game Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. However, Kill Switch was the first third-person shooter to feature the cover system as its core game mechanic, and introduced the blind fire mechanic to the cover system.\n\nSingle .7z file, no password required.\n\n- dabowis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:265034dc7860cb9df0cf58511434617c9df6a6a2","amp;dn":"Kill+Switch+%5BU%5D+%5BPS2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"265034dc7860cb9df0cf58511434617c9df6a6a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,80,52,220,120,96,203,157,240,207,88,81,20,52,97,124,157,246,166,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
