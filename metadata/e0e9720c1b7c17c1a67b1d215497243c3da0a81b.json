Both have had some setbacks in life - Bernie in combat, Chet in K-9 dog-training school - but together they make up a team like no other.\nIn Thereby Hangs a Tail, Bernie and Chet are hired to investigate threats made against an unlikely target - a pretty, pampered show dog named Princess. What seems like a joke turns serious when Princess and her owner are abducted. And to make matters worse, Bernie's on-again, off-again girlfriend, reporter Susie Sanchez, disappears too.\nWhen Chet gets separated from Bernie, he tries to put the pieces together, find his way home, and save the day.\nWith genuine suspense and intrigue, combined with humour and insight into the special bond between man and dog, Thereby Hangs a Tail is the much awaited sequel to the fantastic, funny, New York Times bestselling Dog On It. It will keep everyone talking - and chuckling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e9720c1b7c17c1a67b1d215497243c3da0a81b","amp;dn":"Spencer+Quinn+-+Thereby+Hangs+a+Tail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e9720c1b7c17c1a67b1d215497243c3da0a81b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,233,114,12,27,124,23,193,166,123,29,33,84,151,36,60,61,160,168,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
