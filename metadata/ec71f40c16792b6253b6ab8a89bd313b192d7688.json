However, in the midst of the chaos, six of them manage to escape and find refuge with the Canadian ambassador. Knowing that it is only a matter of time and are most likely to be killed, a CIA specialist in special operations named Tony Mendez (Affleck) concocts a risky plan to get them out of the country safely. A plan so incredible that just might do well in a movie.\n\nProduction notes:\n- Based on an article by Joshua Bearman and published by 'Wired Magazine' about a hostage crisis in Tehran, called 'How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran &quot;(How the CIA used a movie false science fiction to rescue Americans from Tehran).\n- Based on true events, Argo tells a secret operation, life or death, to rescue six Americans in the middle of the hostage crisis in Iran. The truth remained hidden from the public for decades.\n=============================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec71f40c16792b6253b6ab8a89bd313b192d7688","amp;dn":"Argo+%282012%29+%5BMicroHD+1080p%5D%5BDUAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec71f40c16792b6253b6ab8a89bd313b192d7688","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,113,244,12,22,121,43,98,83,182,171,138,137,189,49,59,25,45,118,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
