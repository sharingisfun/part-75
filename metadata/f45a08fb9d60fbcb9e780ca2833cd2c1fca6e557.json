Unprepared for the consequences of their attraction, at first each feigns indifference. But during the restless summer weeks that follow, unrelenting buried currents of obsession and fear, fascination and desire, intensify their passion as they test the charged ground between them. What grows from the depths of their spirits is a romance of scarcely six weeks' duration and an experience that marks them for a lifetime. For what the two discover on the Riviera and during a sultry evening in Rome is the one thing both already fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy.\n\nContains both EPUB &amp; MOBI formats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f45a08fb9d60fbcb9e780ca2833cd2c1fca6e557","amp;dn":"Call+Me+By+Your+Name+-+Andre+Aciman+EPUB+%26amp%3B+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f45a08fb9d60fbcb9e780ca2833cd2c1fca6e557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,90,8,251,157,96,251,203,158,120,12,162,131,60,210,193,252,166,229,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
