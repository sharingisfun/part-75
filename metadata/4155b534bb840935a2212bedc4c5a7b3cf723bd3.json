But as trusted finance reporter Chris Farrell explains, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a silver lining to this cloud: It is accelerating a trend already under way in America toward what he calls the New FrugalityÃ¢â‚¬â€a fresh way of thinking about how, what, and why we consume. In todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economy, a Ã¢â‚¬Å“sustainableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lifestyle isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good for the planetÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one that is based around core values and one that sustains your bank balance as well.\n\nIn this friendly, approachable book, Farrell explains both the theory and the practice of living frugally. Frugality, he reminds us, does not mean old-fashioned penny-pinching. It means spending your money on quality rather than quantityÃ¢â‚¬â€buying the best you can afford but the least you need. Drawing on his expertise as a financial reporter and his years of conversations with his public radio listeners, he provides down-to-earth, practical advice for every aspect of your financial life, including:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ how to always maintain a Ã¢â‚¬Å“margin of safetyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in your spending\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the frugal home: renting vs. owning\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the two best ways to save for college\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ wise debt vs. foolish debt\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ why giving your money away can be Ã¢â‚¬Å“newly frugalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4155b534bb840935a2212bedc4c5a7b3cf723bd3","amp;dn":"The+New+Frugality%3A+How+to+Consume+Less%2C+Save+More%2C+Live+Better+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4155b534bb840935a2212bedc4c5a7b3cf723bd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,85,181,52,187,132,9,53,162,33,43,237,196,197,167,179,207,114,59,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
