The program takes into consideration electrical parameters of the power supply as well as the power distribution system including utility, cables, bus ducts, transformers, generators, motors etc. SCA automatically converts the entire system into a unique impedance unit from which the short circuit current at each and every point is calculated. The process is simple, efficient and will save you both money and time. \n\n*************************************************\nI have included the setup file, user guide, and keygen (created by me). This is everything you need to get started..\n************************************************\n\n--PLEASE NOTE-- I am on a private ip, so sometimes it may seem as though there are no seeders.. If this is the case, please try BOTH the torrent file AND Magnet link (and contacted me + gotten a response) before bad repping me. \n\n********************************************************************************** Loop_DE_Loopz **********************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f21439781afae3b5f911d6a2fe27c6a717fac51","amp;dn":"Short+Circuit+Analytic+V1.0.4+incl.+KEYGEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f21439781afae3b5f911d6a2fe27c6a717fac51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,33,67,151,129,175,174,59,95,145,29,106,47,226,124,106,113,127,172,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
