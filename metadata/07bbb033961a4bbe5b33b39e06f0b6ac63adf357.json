With a total budget of around SEK 210 million (ca. US $30 million) for both films, it is the most expensive production in Swedish cinema.\n\nArn Magnusson is a son of the powerful Folkung dynasty in the mid-12th century. He grows up in a monastery belonging to the Cistercians. He is trained in archery, swordsmanship and horsemanship by a former Knight Templar, the brother Guilbert, who resides in the monastery. When Arn leaves the monastery and returns to his family, he is soon pulled into the struggle between the powerful families, all fighting for the crown of the young nation that is to become the Kingdom of Sweden. He helps his friend Knut Eriksson to kill the old king Karl Sverkersson. This leads to war between the two factions; Arn and his fiancÃƒÂ©e Cecilia Algotsdotter are excommunicated for premarital relations and are forced to undertake twenty years of penance, Cecilia in a convent and Arn as a Knight Templar in the Holy Land to fight against the Saracens.\n\nWhile pursuing a band of thieves, Arn comes across the very enemy of all Christendom, Saladin, and saves his life. Saladin thanks Arn by warning him away from Jerusalem, because he is leading a vast army towards the city. As Saladin marches upon Jerusalem, Arn is given the order to intercept the Saracens before they reach the city, and they successfully ambush Saladin's army in a mountain pass (the ambush taking the place of the historical Battle of Montgisard figuring in the novel). The movie ends with Arn gaining a letter discharging him from his service in the Holy Land from the Templar Grandmaster Arnold of Torroja, and Cecilia giving praise to God on hearing news of Arn's survival.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07bbb033961a4bbe5b33b39e06f0b6ac63adf357","amp;dn":"Arn+-+Tempelriddaren+%28Arn+-+The+Knight+Templar%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07bbb033961a4bbe5b33b39e06f0b6ac63adf357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,187,176,51,150,26,75,190,91,51,179,158,6,240,182,172,99,173,243,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
