The &quot;starter wives&quot; raised the children, kept the homes and stood by their men through it all.\n\n But in the end, these relationships soured. The women were left to start over and figure out how to get along with their famous exes well enough to raise children together. Josie, Liza, Tashera, Monica, Zakia and Cheryl are moving on and creating new lives that will afford them (and their children) the security, success and happiness they know they deserve.\n\n\n\n A big thank you to all original cappers and posters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00713916345296adc2e937607f00cb485821e325","amp;dn":"Starter+Wives+Confidential+S01E01+Let+Go+Or+Get+Dragged+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00713916345296adc2e937607f00cb485821e325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,113,57,22,52,82,150,173,194,233,55,96,127,0,203,72,88,33,227,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
