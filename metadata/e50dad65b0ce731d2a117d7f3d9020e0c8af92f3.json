Its like the artists still are digesting their short holidays. The music lacked the creativity, innovation and inspiration it normally has.\n\nI am always looking for best quality (sound) songs that really tell you something, give you something, instead of mainly drawing attention to them selves. In short, I am not looking for artists which make music, instead I am looking for music that makes the artists. I listened a lot but did not find too much (So, some old favorites I heard recently are included.)\n\nI added 1 second of silence between the songs; feels more at ease. Less jumpy and still quick enough to carry over some feeling (charge) from one song to the next.\n\nEnjoy\n\n\nDutch Treat - Indie Playlists 1301\n\nI1 No Strings\n\n01 Ocean Colour Scene (Big Star)\n02 Cold Specks (Hector)\n03 Revolver (Losing You)\n04 Tessa Rose Jackson (Change Time)\n05 Shakey Graves (Im On Fire)\n06 Andy Shauf (Jerry Was A Clerk)\n07 Swim Deep (The Sea)\n08 Minttu &amp; Olli (Chimney Sweeper)\n09 Last Lynx (Killing Switch)\n10 Bike Thief (Ghost Of Providence)\n11 El Perro Del Mar (Walk On By (Dionne Warwick))\n12 ChlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½e Howl (No Strings)\n13 Ocean Colour Scene (Another Girls Name)\n14 Julia Holter (Gold Dust Woman (Fleetwood Mac Cover))\n15 Rhythms Del Mundo (Losing My Religion (Africa Mix) (Rem, Ali Farka Toure Band])\n16 Rhythms Del Mundo (She Said (Africa Mix) (Plan B))\n17 Holychild (Watching Waiting)\n18 Loot &amp; Plunder (Thinkin Bout Your Body (Cousin Culo Edit))\n19 Kimbra (Two Way Street (Aeroplane Remix))\n20 Maths Time Joy (Let Go)\n21 Carly Rae Jepsen (Your Heart Is A Muscle)\n22 Richard Cheese (Stairway To Heaven (Led Zeppelin))\n23 St. Vincent &amp; The National (Sleep All Summer (Crooked Fingers))\n24 Michael Kiwanuka (Worry Walks Beside Me)\n25 Joan Of Arc (King Song)\n\nI2 Heart Strings\n\n01 Mndr (Faster Horses)\n02 Skip The Use (Cup Of Coffee)\n03 Imagine Dragons (Amsterdam)\n04 Dark Hearts (Heart Strings)\n05 Iremembertapes (All I Know)\n06 A Silent Film (Danny, Dakota &amp; The Wishing Well)\n07 Art Of Sleeping (Empty Hands)\n08 Walk The Moon (I Can Lift A Car)\n09 Handsome Poets (Sky On Fire)\n10 Ben Folds (Such Great Heights)\n11 Call The Doctor (For Your Leisure)\n12 Green Day (Nice Guys Finish Last)\n13 Caribou (Tits &amp; Ass The Great Canadian Weekend)\n14 White Noise (Gaz Coombes)\n15 Swiss Lips (In The Water)\n16 Green Day (Hitchin' A Ride)\n17 Guards (Coming True)\n18 Geike (This Page)\n19 The Eastern Sea (Santa Rosa)\n20 Absofacto (Lies)\n21 Machines Are People Too (The Fever)\n\nI3 Fresh Eyes\n\n01 2010 Baden Baden (78)\n02 The Plastics (Stereo Kids (Reprise))\n03 Mac Demarco (Ode To Viceroy)\n04 Nautic (Fresh Eyes)\n05 The Crookes (Maybe In The Dark)\n06 The Belligerents (She Calls The Shots)\n07 Phillip Phillips (Get Up Get Down)\n08 Royal Wood (The Thick Of It)\n09 New Found Land (Mirror)\n10 Bloc Party (V.A.L.I.S)\n11 The Antlers &amp; Brent Arnold (Empty Castles (No Widows Refracted))\n12 Northeast Party House (Pascal Cavalier)\n13 Marina &amp; The Diamonds (Bubblegum Bitch)\n14 The Sight Of Love (The Camerawalls)\n15 N8 St9 (Keep On Rollin')\n16 Atlas Genius (Back Seat)\n17 The Lumineers (Stubborn Love)\n18 Ellie Lawson (La)\n19 Ivy (L'anamour)\n20 Bryan John Appleby (Honey Jars)\n21 Muse (Madness (Tw Remix))\n22 Hot Chip (Look At Where We Are)\n23 We Avalanche (One Day Soon)\n24 Local Natives (Heavy Feet)\n25 Wild Child (Tale Of You &amp; Me)\n\nI5 Ice Cream\n\n01 Mitzi (All I Heard)\n02 Stand Up Against Heart Crime (Am I Safe)\n03 [Housemusic365.Com] (New Lands (A-Trak Remix))\n04 2005 New Young Pony Club (Ice Cream)\n05 Alesso vs. Supabeatz (Deep Love Ft.
