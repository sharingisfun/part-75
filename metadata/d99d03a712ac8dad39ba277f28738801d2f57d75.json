He also wishes to end crime in the world and create a utopia in which he reigns supreme. His life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers the Death Note, a notebook that contains five written instructions:\n\n-The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die.\n-This notebook will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.\n-If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.\n-If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.\n-After writing the cause of death, the details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 second","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d99d03a712ac8dad39ba277f28738801d2f57d75","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5DDeathnote%5B480P%5D%5BDual-Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d99d03a712ac8dad39ba277f28738801d2f57d75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,157,3,167,18,172,141,173,57,186,39,127,40,115,136,1,210,245,125,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
