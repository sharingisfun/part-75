This can finally be witnessed here on this deluxe remastered CD set, which encapsulates all of the bands recorded output from their Capitol Records Period, which spanned from 1971-1974. Also included in here is the previously unreleased, debut album Death of a Country, which was initially rejected by Capitol, as being a heavy concept album, they thought no one would understand. Highly regarded as a cult act by many for years, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now time for this truly amazing rock band to be enjoyed by a new audience.
