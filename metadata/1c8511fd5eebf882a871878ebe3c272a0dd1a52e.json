And then it will force a logout of Windows.\n\nWindows will effectively become useless, and all users will be prevented from logging into the system.\nFurthermore, the desktop will have so many files, that Windows will stop responding - preventing the user from deleting the files.\n\n\nAs always, there is a way to remove the application:\n\n1. Boot up in Safe-Mode.\n\n2. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).\n\n3. Browse to this key:\n   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run\n\n4. Delete the value named &quot;FUBAR DeskFiller 2013&quot;.\n\n\nAlthough this application can be quite easily removed, the user will have plenty of &quot;fun&quot; trying to clean up the desktop...\n\n\n\n/Ubehage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c8511fd5eebf882a871878ebe3c272a0dd1a52e","amp;dn":"FUBAR+DeskFiller+2013.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c8511fd5eebf882a871878ebe3c272a0dd1a52e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,133,17,253,94,235,248,130,168,113,135,142,190,60,39,42,13,209,165,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
