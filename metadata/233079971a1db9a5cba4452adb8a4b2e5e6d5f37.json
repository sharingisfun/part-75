In the united Physics breakthrough, if possible should exist in its all areas. The only Ã¢â‚¬Å“legalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ way to explain possible violation of Conservation Laws is by following the statement that they do not act in nonlinear systems and no inertia frame of reference. What nonlinearity is? The First Newtonian Law indicates the inherent two qualities of mass: to conserve its linear velocity and direction. But the Second and Third Newtonian Laws and all Classical Physics explore the effects of the changed linear velocity only forming the Linear Concept like the only possible one. The inertial effects of the changed direction of motion are pointed like fictive ones but they can be formulated by Laws of Nonlinear Dynamics. Antipode principles describe differences between Linear and Nonlinear Concepts. The real finding of NoetherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theorems is that symmetrical (linear) interactions operating in symmetrical space do not produce breakthrough effects. The Energy aspect is expressed by the Principles of the Broken and Conserved Perpendicularity. The Third Classical Limit states that Classical Physics is correct in Linear aspect only.
