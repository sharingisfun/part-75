I have re-authored the four DVD set into three DVDs with a simple main menu for each DVD. This torrent is not a RAR file so you can download only those DVDs that you need or are interested in.\n\nFor those that have an Epson printer that can print on the label of printable DVDs I have included the Epson Print CD installation file along with all of the DVD covers I created. I have also included DVD labels for the &quot;Building the Ruger 10/22&quot; DVD set also uploaded by shadowfoxs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506e22c452404371cafa71a7dbaf64c9edff451c","amp;dn":"AGI+The+Secret+life+of+Bob+Dunlap+Improved","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506e22c452404371cafa71a7dbaf64c9edff451c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,110,34,196,82,64,67,113,202,250,113,167,219,175,100,201,237,255,69,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
