They will\ntry to argue that it's the previously on but nowhere either on screen\nor on the audio track does it mention this is Previously On &quot;The Lying Game&quot;\nTypically shows will have one or both of those occur so we know this happened\nin the past\n\nIt's clearly the setup for the entire show, similar to the opening of Burn Notice\nwhere it explains . In addition the ABCF bug is already full formed and\nin place and the TV rating one is long gone. There's no point in these CRF days to cut\nthat and it shows a sloppy careless approach to preing TV. No quality gained by removing\nit\n\nI say we remove the optional wording for Previously On in the rules and give people\nwhat they want. Protect for glitches if you want (in those sections) which is why\nthe rule was initially put in but come on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4777323f4281e503b09877ab25cdabc3e8fcbac","amp;dn":"The+Lying+Game+S02E03+PROPER+HDTV+x264-2HD%5Bettv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4777323f4281e503b09877ab25cdabc3e8fcbac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,119,115,35,244,40,30,80,59,9,135,122,178,92,218,188,62,143,203,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
