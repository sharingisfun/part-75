Devised by Paul Duddridge, it concerns the making of a comedy panel game show called Annually Retentive, themed around historical events, and hosted by Welsh comedian Rob Brydon. The show is deliberately parodic, as Brydon plays a hyper-realised (and exaggeratedly nasty) version of himself, while the game show blatantly steals ideas from other, similar shows such as Have I Got News For You, Never Mind the Buzzcocks, Mock The Week and QI.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7805b450dc7327c08807c24d3d69e2bba1501e0","amp;dn":"Annually+Retentive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7805b450dc7327c08807c24d3d69e2bba1501e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,128,91,69,13,199,50,124,8,128,124,36,211,214,158,43,186,21,1,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
