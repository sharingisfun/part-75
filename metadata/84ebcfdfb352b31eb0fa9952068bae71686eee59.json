The recording process was, however, often fraught with arguments amongst the band as to the sound and direction of the album. However, the group were pleased with the finished results and three singles were released from the album: &quot;Chaos&quot;, &quot;Charlton Heston&quot; (which reached number 72 in the UK singles charts in August 1988 and therefore became their only national chart success) and a re-released &quot;Buffalo&quot; (the latter only featuring on the US edition of the album). The album did not bring the crossover success the label had hoped for and, after recording a few b-sides and some demos, a demoralised group split at the end of the year.\n\nA1 Living It Down 2:59\t\nA2 In The Green\t3:40\t\nA3 Roll The Bodies Over 3:40\t\nA4 Bone\t3:47\t\nA5 Buffalo 4:10\t\nA6 Chaos 3:55\t\nB1 Alcohol 4:01\t\nB2 Charlton Heston 3:26\t\nB3 Heartache 3:02\t\nB4 Doctor (A Visit To The) 4:27\t\nB5 A Fierce Pancake 4:03\t\nB6 Boggy Home 1:51\n\nCredits:\nArt Direction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Daryl Lee\nBass, Sampler [Samples] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kev Hopper\nDrums, BodhrÃƒÂ¡n Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Robert McKahey\nGuitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chris Salmon\nKeyboards, Vocals [Occasional] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mimi Izumi Kobayashi\nPhotography By [Additional] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alistair Thane, Richard Burbridge\nPhotography By [Front Cover] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fergus Bourke\nProducer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Holger Hiller (tracks: A1 to A6, B1, B3 to B6), John Robie (tracks: B2)\nProducer [Post-production], Mixed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hugh Jones\nProducer, Design [Sleeve] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stump (tracks: A1 to A6, B1, B3 to B6)\nRecorded By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stephen Street\nVocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mick Lynch\nWritten-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stump","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84ebcfdfb352b31eb0fa9952068bae71686eee59","amp;dn":"Stump+-+A+Fierce+Pancake+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84ebcfdfb352b31eb0fa9952068bae71686eee59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,235,207,223,179,82,179,30,176,250,153,82,6,139,174,113,104,110,238,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
