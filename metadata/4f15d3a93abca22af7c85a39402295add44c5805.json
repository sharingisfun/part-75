It relies on phase variance just like stereophonic sound. The sound characteristics of holophonics are most clearly heard through headphones though they can be effectively demonstrated with 2-channel stereo speakers, provided that they are phase-coherent. The word &quot;holophonics&quot; is related to the concept of an &quot;acoustic hologram&quot;. \n\nSamizdat (Russian) [sÃ‰â„¢mizÃ‹Ë†dat] \n(in the former Soviet Union) \n(Communication Arts / Journalism &amp; Publishing) \na. a system of clandestine printing and distribution of banned or dissident literature \nb. (as modifier) a samizdat publication \n[from Russian, literally: self-published] \n\nHolophonic Samizdat is the second full length album from Montreal-based producer DJ Sarcastic. \n!onelove","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f15d3a93abca22af7c85a39402295add44c5805","amp;dn":"DJ+Sarcastic+-+Holophonic+Samizdat+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f15d3a93abca22af7c85a39402295add44c5805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,21,211,169,58,188,162,42,247,200,90,57,64,34,149,173,212,76,88,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
