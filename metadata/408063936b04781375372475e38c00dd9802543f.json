During the era that Satisfaction Guaranteed covers, Smith scored more Top 10 hits than either Hank Williams or Lefty Frizzell, and many of his best songs -- &quot;Loose Talk,&quot; &quot;Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way,&quot; &quot;Hey Joe!,&quot; &quot;Are You Teasing Me,&quot; and &quot;(When You Feel Like You're In Love) Don't Just Stand There,&quot; among them -- are stone-cold honky tonk classics. For serious Smith and honky tonk fans, the set is essential, but the sheer length of the box -- not to mention its strict chronological sequence -- is tedious for anyone that isn't willing to dedicate the time to plow through the abundance of material here. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine Every song that Carl Smith recorded during the '50s is included on Satisfaction Guaranteed, a five-disc, 143-track box set that stands as the most comprehensive retrospective of the honky tonk star's peak period.
