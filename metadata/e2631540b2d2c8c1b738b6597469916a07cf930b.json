He then finds himself transported to an exotic new world, complete with its own cast of eccentric characters, including an enigmatic green-skinned woman and a wizard with a penchant for bathrobes. However, as John attempts to understand this bizarre land, his unusual vacation is cut short when an unexpected enemy makes an appearance.\n\nWielding weapons never before seen in that world, the surrounding region is quickly thrown into turmoil. Though still unsure over why exactly he was brought there, John finds that he may hold a key in helping to understand their adversary.
