The film was a political satire targeted on the Hindu nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The film was also made in Hindi language.\n\nThe film owes its success to the dialogues by Acharya PK Atre in the Marathi version and Pandit Indra in the Hindi version. The situations in which the hero finds himself sparkle with wit and the film moves along at a quick tempo greatly helped by Vinayak's performance in the central role, a simple minded innocent pitted against entrenched hypocrisy and fossilized beliefs. Though he was called Audumbar in the Marathi version, in the Hindi version he was called Kanhaiya and was a total antithesis of the original Kanhaiya (Lord Krishna) the great lover. Vinayak's aversion to religious bigotry and social hypocrisy combined with Atre's keen sense of satire make for an extremely entertaining film with outrageous humour and gentle mockery. \n\nAtre paired with Master Vinayak for the second time for this film after the 1937 film Dharmaveer. Apart from the witty dialogues and satirical theme, the film became popular for Shirodkar's seductive song sequence wearing a swimsuit.\n\nAudumbar is a young and ordinary man. On one occasion he happens to listen to the lecture given by Deshbhakta Jatashankar. Jatashankar in his speech emphasizes on discipline and celibacy, the pricipals of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. This speech inspires Audumbar and he decides to join the institute of Acharya Chandiram. He renounces his sexual desires and also throws away his collection of posters of film actors.\n\nBut at the institute, he comes across Kishori, a young woman and all his vows to Brahmacharya are tested.\n\n\nPralhad Keshav Atre, who had previously published many novels, poems and also written stories and dialogues for films, paired with Master Vinayak for the second time for this film. Previously they had worked together on the 1937 Marathi film Dharmaveer, which was a religious satire.\n\nThe film was actress Meenakshi Shirodkar's debut film. She had previously worked in theatre. The film became notable for the song sequence &quot;Yamuna Jali Khelu Khel&quot; where Shirodkar wore a swimsuit. The scene involved the character Kishori trying to seduce Audumbar while bathing on a ghat.\n\nThe film had dialogues written by Atre, who is known for his sense of humour. His satirical handling of political nationalist party Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's ideologies in the Marathi medium and Pandit Indra's writing for the Hindi medium brought in audiences. Critics have also credited the success of the film to these strong dialogue writers. Apart from the dialogues, the film's main attraction was Shirodkar's song sequence with the swimsuit that brought repeat audience and also brought fame to Shirodkar. The film was a hit at box-office and ran for twenty five weeks in Mumbai and for fifty in Pune.The then critics had also criticized the bold song sequence.\n\nAfter stunning the traditional Marathi audience and despite the criticism for the bold scene, the film brought popularity for Shirodkar. Her twin-plait hairstyle also became popular and trendy in teenage girls. The pair of Master Vinayak and Shirodkar was well received by audiences. The two went on to play successful lead roles in various film like Brandichi Batli (1939), Ardhangi / Ghar Ki Rani (1940), Amrut (1941), Mazhe Bal (1943) and more.\n\nThe film was also adapted as a play of same name in 1984. It starred Prashant Damle and Varsha Usgaonkar in lead roles and was directed by Damu Kenkre. The music was revived by Ashok Patki and the popular song &quot;Yamuna Jali Khelu Khel&quot; was still maintained with Usgaonkar now in swimsuit trying to seduce Damle. The play proved to be a turning point for the current female lead also. Usgaonkar was noticed by director-actor Sachin Pilgaonkar, who then launched her in films through Gammat Jammat.\n\nThe song &quot;Yamuna Jali Khelu Khel&quot; still remains popular. After its use in Kenkre's play, the song was recently also used in the film Pratibimb (2011). Sung by new comer Sampada Hire, the music is composed by Avadhoot Gupte and is picturised on Ankush Choudhary and Sonali Kulkarni.\n\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Brahmachari (1938)\nThis film addresses the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organization emphasizing celibacy and discipline, which became the power base of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
