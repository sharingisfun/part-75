Kane's voice and appearance were a likely source for Fleischer Studios animator Grim Natwick when creating Betty Boop, although &quot;It-girl&quot; Clara Bow is another possible influence. \n         She spent the early 1920s trouping in vaudeville as a singer and kickline dancer with a theater engagement called the 'All Jazz Revue.' She played the New York Palace for the first time in 1921. Her Broadway days started there as well with the Stars of the Future (1922Ã¢â‚¬â€œ24, and a brief revival in early 1927). She also sang onstage with an early singing trio, the Hamilton Sisters and Fordyce, later known as The Three X Sisters. Kane's career break came in 1927, when she appeared in a musical called &quot;A Night in Spain&quot;. It ran from May 3, 1927 through Nov 12, 1927 for a total of 174 performances, at the 44th Street Theatre in NYC. Subsequently, Paul Ash, a band conductor, put her name forward for a performance at New York's Paramount Theater\n         Kane recorded 22 songs between 1928 and 1930. After 1930 and up to 1951, she recorded four sides for Columbia in addition to the &quot;Three Little Words&quot; soundtrack single recording of &quot;I Wanna Be Loved by You&quot; She also recorded four songs that comprise a 1954 MGM 45Ep entitled, &quot;The Boop Boop a Doop Girl&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716c10a06b7ba9bbf19c1030930b675f31c31c91","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+459","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716c10a06b7ba9bbf19c1030930b675f31c31c91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,108,16,160,107,123,169,187,241,156,16,48,147,11,103,95,49,195,28,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
