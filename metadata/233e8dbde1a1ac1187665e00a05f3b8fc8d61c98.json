Frankenstein continued its run until Prize Comics #52 in April 1945. Briefer eventually morphed him into a humorous character.  He also had his own Comic from Prize which also was humorous in tone, but toward series end it did return to it's Horror roots\n\n\nThis torrent includes the complete run in Prize comics (A good read for the other features as well, my personal favorite is the Black Owl) and as many complete scanned issues of the Franestein comic as I could find.  There should be no incomplete comics in this torrent\n\n\nPlease seed   as my bandwidth is limited and we want others to enjoy the weirdly wonderful monster book from the Golden age!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:233e8dbde1a1ac1187665e00a05f3b8fc8d61c98","amp;dn":"Frankestein+Golden+age+1940-1948","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"233e8dbde1a1ac1187665e00a05f3b8fc8d61c98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,62,141,189,225,161,172,17,135,102,94,0,160,95,59,143,200,214,28,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
