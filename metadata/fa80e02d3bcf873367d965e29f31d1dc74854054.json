They are:\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer Classic 01 = Spike and Dru 03\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer Classic 02 = Buffy: The Origin 01, 02, 03\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer Classic 03 = Buffy 51, 52, 53, 54\n\nrakib2099, I hope this helps!  --STFmaryville","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa80e02d3bcf873367d965e29f31d1dc74854054","amp;dn":"BUFFY+THE+VAMPIRE+SLAYER+%26ndash%3B+8+selected+issues+%281999-2003%29+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa80e02d3bcf873367d965e29f31d1dc74854054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,128,224,45,59,207,135,51,103,217,101,226,159,49,209,220,116,133,64,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
