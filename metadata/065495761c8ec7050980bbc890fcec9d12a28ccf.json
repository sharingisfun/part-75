Powerful and artful, and ten years in the writing, it is a masterwork from Jamie O'Neill. Jim Mack is a naive young scholar and the son of a foolish, aspiring shopkeeper. Doyler Doyle is the rough-diamond son -- revolutionary and blasphemous -- of Mr. Mack's old army pal. Out at the Forty Foot, that great jut of rock where gentlemen bathe in the nude, the two boys make a pact: Doyler will teach Jim to swim, and in a year, on Easter of 1916, they will swim to the distant beacon of Muglins Rock and claim that island for themselves.\n\nThis torrent contains both the EPUB and MOBI formats of Jamie O'Neill's critically acclaimed novel, At Swim, Two Boys.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed so that others may also enjoy this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065495761c8ec7050980bbc890fcec9d12a28ccf","amp;dn":"At+Swim%2C+Two+Boys+-+Jamie+O%27Neill+EPUB+and+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065495761c8ec7050980bbc890fcec9d12a28ccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,84,149,118,28,142,199,5,9,128,187,200,144,252,236,157,18,162,140,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
