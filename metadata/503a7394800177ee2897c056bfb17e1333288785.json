I fixed as best I can a problem with the green textures on the water of Balur's Gate 1. They are in jpeg format with minimal quality loss.\n\nThese are NOT the maps used in the mini-map. These are the large resolution textures used in the main game. To my knowledge, I am the only one who is providing these. Therefore, get this data spread out and distributed.\n\nIf you have any questions, comment on pirate bay. Check out the other torrents I have, they might be useful, as they're all related. Let me know if you like this by commenting and seeding. This is a niche market, so seeders would be great.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:503a7394800177ee2897c056bfb17e1333288785","amp;dn":"High+Res+Infinity+Engine+Maps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"503a7394800177ee2897c056bfb17e1333288785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,58,115,148,128,1,119,238,40,151,192,86,191,177,126,19,51,40,135,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
