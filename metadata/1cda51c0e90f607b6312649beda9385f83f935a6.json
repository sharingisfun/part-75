Created by award winning Director, Anthony M. Bongiovi and shot with 23 High Definition cameras, Live From Madison Square Garden features a career spanning set list including &quot;Have A Nice Day&quot;, &quot;Always&quot;, &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive&quot;, &quot;LivinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ On A Prayer&quot; and even a cover of Leonard CohenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; that Cohen himself rates as his favourite version. This is a snapshot of a band 25 years into a record breaking career and still hitting their peak in the live arena.\nThe Blu-ray version contains a special extra, filmmaker Phil GriffinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recently released Bon Jovi documentary When We Were Beautiful. Following the band on 2008Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s world tour and panning back through their history, it is a fascinating insight into the workings, art, camaraderie, ups and downs of a truly megastar rock band.\n\n\nÃÅ¡ÃÂ°Ã‘â€¡ÃÂµÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃÂ²ÃÂ¾: Blu-Ray (BD-50 Dual-Layer Disc)\nÃÅ¡ÃÂ¾ÃÂ½Ã‘â€šÃÂµÃÂ¹ÃÂ½ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬: BDMV\nÃâ€™ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ¾: VC-1 Video, 1920 kbps, 1080p, 23,976 fps, 16:9, Advanced Profile 3\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾ #1: English Dolby TrueHD Audio, 5.1, 48 kHz, 4377 kbps, 24-bit (AC3 Embedded: 5.1, 48 kHz, 640 kbps)\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾ #2: English Dolby Digital Audio, 2.0, 48 kHz, 448 kbps \n\nLost Highway\nBorn To Be My Baby\nBlaze Of Glory\nIt's My Life\nKeep The Faith\nRaise Your Hands\nLiving In Sin/Chapel Of Love\nAlways\nWhole Lot Of Lovin'\nIn These Arms\nWe Got It Going On\nI'll Be There For You\n(You Want To) Make A Memory\nBlood On Blood\nDry County\nHave A Nice Day\nWho Says You Can't Go Home\nHallelujah\nWanted Dead Or Alive\nLivin' On A Prayer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cda51c0e90f607b6312649beda9385f83f935a6","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+Live+at+Madison+Square+Garden+Bluray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cda51c0e90f607b6312649beda9385f83f935a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,218,81,192,233,15,96,123,99,18,100,155,237,169,56,95,131,249,53,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
