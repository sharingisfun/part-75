Born in Memphis in 1944, Ray Stinnett got his first guitar, aged 12, from Nathan NovakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pawn shop, where Elvis got his first guitar. Heading back down Beale Street afterwards, the family stopped at a light and a huge pink Cadillac pulled up beside them. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And oh my god Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it was Elvis!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ recalls Ray, Ã¢â‚¬Å“So I held up my guitar and shouted, Ã¢â‚¬ËœHey Elvis!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and he looks over and says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey cat.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ray told his father he was going to work hard and make a gold recordÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ just like ElvisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ He achieved his promise with Sam The Sham &amp; The Pharaohs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wooly Bully was the number one selling record of 1965. At 21, Stinnett was living a life of world tours and screaming fans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the whole maniaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ By 1967, the summer of love, Ray left for Haight Ashbury in San Francisco with his wife and young son, taking up residence at the legendary Morning Star Ranch, where Ray focused on finding his true voice. Returning to Memphis a year later, Ray formed a working friendship with Booker T Jones, who produced RayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unreleased Sun Tree at Pepper West album. Eventually, when Jones moved to Malibu and took a contract with A&amp;M, he lined up a deal for his old friend. Still working in Memphis with (old) friends Jerry Paterson and Mike Plunk on bass, along with Booker T. and co-mixer/engineer Richard Rosebrough (Chris Bell, Big Star), Ray channelled his experiences in the pop machine, at Morningstar and beyond into the songs that would become A Fire SomewhereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The songs contained the fried country twang and boogie-woogie grooves of his hometown and of his youth, but were also threaded through with the new psychedelia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shreds of distorted guitar, looping experimental jams and acoustic renditions. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Art is a reflection of life,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Ray of the making of A Fire Somewhere, Ã¢â‚¬Å“and my life was full of reflection at this time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perhaps exactly that fact which kept this incredible record unreleased for all these years\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dbbf17b42004ba201c043e4f5acc79f3a88b512","amp;dn":"Ray+Stinnett+-+A+Fire+Somewhere%5B1968%5D+%282012+Reissue%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dbbf17b42004ba201c043e4f5acc79f3a88b512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,187,241,123,66,0,75,162,1,192,67,228,245,172,199,159,58,136,181,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
