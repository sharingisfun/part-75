Unhappily married to a woman who suffers from mental illness, he is attracted to her and they make a date to go sailing, arriving at Philip's country home just as a storm is breaking. Helen learns who he is for the first time, a celebrated-and-famous concert pianist and, falling in love with him, decides to leave before matters go further. A hurricane hits and their car is crippled by a falling tree. Rising water forces then to seek shelter in the choir loft of a church, where they spend the night. They are rescued in the morning and Helen meets Philip's wife, and learns their story. Helen and Philip meet once more, and Philip sails to Europe with his wife but promises to come back some day\n\n\nCast: Irene Dunne, Charles Boyer, Barbara O'Neil, Onslow Stewens\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032124/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032124/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDuration: 01:27:49\n\nFile size: 897 MB\nPicture: 592*448\nAudio: 48 kHz (mono)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8b991df6860633c4e05b8aa5868efe1cc1dd736","amp;dn":"When+Tomorrow+Comes+%5B1939%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8b991df6860633c4e05b8aa5868efe1cc1dd736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,185,145,223,104,96,99,60,78,5,184,170,88,104,239,225,204,29,215,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
