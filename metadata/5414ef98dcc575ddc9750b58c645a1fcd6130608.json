(November 2012)\n\nNadya Denise Doud-Suleman (born Natalie Denise Suleman July 11, 1975[a]), known as Octomom in the media, is an Iraqi-American woman who came to international attention when she gave birth to octuplets in January 2009.[2][3] The Suleman octuplets are only the second full set of octuplets to be born alive in the United States. One week after their birth, they surpassed the previous worldwide survival rate for a complete set of octuplets set by the Chukwu octuplets in 1998. The circumstances of their high order multiple birth have led to controversy in the field of assisted reproductive technology as well as an investigation by the Medical Board of California of the fertility specialist involved.[4]\n\nPublic reaction turned negative when it was discovered that Suleman already had six other young children and was unemployed and on public assistance programs. Suleman conceived the octuplets and her six older children via in vitro fertilization (IVF).[5] Although she initially denied ever having used public assistance,[6] she confirmed in April 2012 on NBC's Today show that she was indeed on public assistance.\nContents\n\n    ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5414ef98dcc575ddc9750b58c645a1fcd6130608","amp;dn":"OCTOMOM+HOME+ALONE+%28WICKED+PICTURES%29+XXX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5414ef98dcc575ddc9750b58c645a1fcd6130608","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,20,239,152,220,197,117,221,201,117,11,88,198,69,161,252,214,19,6,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
