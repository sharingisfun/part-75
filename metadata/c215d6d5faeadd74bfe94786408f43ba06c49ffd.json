The Turtles are back. Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and\nMichelangelo are four mutant turtles, trained in the art of &quot;ninjutsu&quot;\nby their sensei, Master Splinter. The animated series explores their\ncamaraderie as they learn to rely on one another as they unravel the\nmystery of their existence and train to become the heroes they are\ndestined to be. And they're doing all that while trying to defeat\nMaster Shredder, an old enemy of Splinter who is training a peculiar\nband of ninjas while hiding in New York City. When they are in the\nsurface world, the Turtles become involved in a conspiracy involving\nalien creatures, robotic droids and missing scientists.
