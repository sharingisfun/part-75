For years she's been making album after album of beautifully crafted songs.\n\nGryner's signature piano sound is less dominant on Goddess. Filling the void are elegant cello and violin arrangements (&quot;Goddess&quot;). The guitars and drums are also turned up on the album, making songs like &quot;Empty Hole&quot; some of her hardest ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cf6487ce0d492dfa6c1c9b4e78b44f4f5a2d96e","amp;dn":"Emm+Gryner+-+Goddess+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cf6487ce0d492dfa6c1c9b4e78b44f4f5a2d96e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,246,72,124,224,212,146,223,166,193,201,180,231,139,68,244,245,162,217,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
