From this twisted hotchpotch of legend, ritual, religion and fairy-tale, the Third Reich created their own unique faith. Race, love, sex, war, history, geology, education, health, astronomy, and music were all covered by the gospels of the Nazis. Here was a new way to understand human life, the natural world and the supernatural, the history of the planet and the working of the cosmos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6298faa1fe9f3701b7f5014a7f02e222add53a49","amp;dn":"h2-the.nazi.gospels.hdtv.mw.xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6298faa1fe9f3701b7f5014a7f02e222add53a49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,152,250,161,254,159,55,1,183,245,1,74,127,2,226,34,173,213,58,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
