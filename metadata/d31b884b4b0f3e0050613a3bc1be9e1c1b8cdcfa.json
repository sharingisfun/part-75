Xcultures entry into this arena, One World One People, succeeds fairly well, bringing together voice and New Age synth sounds with modern 4/4 beats and ethnic instrumentation. Unlike other artists Xcultures doesn't sound too terribly cheesy, mixing West African drumming with Moroccan chanting, Scottish low whistle with Senegalese vocals. Make no mistake, this is still New Age music with panpipes and thick synth, but Brian Wayy's vision has a dark ethereal aspect that takes itself seriously. Therefore, it resembles the work of Deep Forest while transcending the squeaky clean sound of Adiemus. One-third of the royalties from the CD's sales will be donated to combat world hunger. A decent world-groove CD with fat beats. --Karen K. Hugg\n\n\n\nThis album takes you from the most advanced societies to the most desolate third world nations, using lush dance grooves &amp; exotic vocals &amp; chanting - everyone who enjoys ambient groups Deep Forest, Enigma &amp; B Tribe will love this album - one third of the artist royalties will be sent directly to CARE to help feed hungry children throughout the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31b884b4b0f3e0050613a3bc1be9e1c1b8cdcfa","amp;dn":"Xcultures-One+World+One+People+Mp3%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31b884b4b0f3e0050613a3bc1be9e1c1b8cdcfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,27,136,75,75,15,62,0,80,97,58,59,193,190,158,28,27,140,220,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
