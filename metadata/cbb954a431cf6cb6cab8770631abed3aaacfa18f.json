Each has a different cover and the last story page is different, so because of the different story page, we felt it better to release the two versions separately, rather than packing them into one.\n\n'DE-PROGRAMMED,' Part One MILESTONE 225th issue! AND...FOR THE FIRST TIME...the results of a Presidential Election will directly affect the events to come. On November 6th, the citizens of the United States of America will select their Commander In Chief. The winner, and his goals and agendas, will play a role in shaping the next stage in Jim Downing's evolution. Meanwhile...Jim's long search for answers about his past comes to an end in this two-part story, featuring the return of fan-favorite villain, Jason Wynn. Wynn, the master puppeteer whose manipulations led to Al Simmons' original fall from grace, now lays bare the full truth regarding Jim's role in 'The Project.' But what are Wynn's true intentions? And what ramifications do they have on global events.\n\nThanks goes to HALO and theProletariat for this release.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7890472/Spawn_220_(2012)_(1440px_&amp;_2048px-HD)_(theFragile-Novus)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7890472/Spawn_220_(2012)_(1440px_&amp;_2048px-HD)_(theFragile-Novus)&lt;/a&gt;\t\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7890486/Spawn_221-223_(2012)_(1440px_&amp;_2048px-HD)_(HALOTaru-Novus)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7890486/Spawn_221-223_(2012)_(1440px_&amp;_2048px-HD)_(HALOTaru-Novus)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8009024/Spawn_226_(2013)_(c2c)_(1440px&amp;2048px-HD)_(theFragile-Novus)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8009024/Spawn_226_(2013)_(c2c)_(1440px&amp;2048px-HD)_(theFragile-Novus)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbb954a431cf6cb6cab8770631abed3aaacfa18f","amp;dn":"Spawn+225+%28Obama+and+Romney+Wins%29%281440%26amp%3B2048px-HD%29%28theFragile","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbb954a431cf6cb6cab8770631abed3aaacfa18f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,185,84,164,49,207,108,182,202,184,119,6,49,171,237,58,170,207,161,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
