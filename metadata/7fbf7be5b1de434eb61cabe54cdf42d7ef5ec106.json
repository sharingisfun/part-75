This is  why  you  see  the  original  exe  renamed  to\n &quot;TDFerrari_o.exe&quot;.  As this is not allowed and in  this  case  considerably\n slows down the game with Xlive messages  while  starting  and  playing  the\n game, you can see why we have included a proper cracked.  SKIDROW  use  the\n loader to bypass the steam &quot;bind&quot; stub to  not  have  to  bypass  the  G4WL\n integrity checks and hence leaving the drm intact.  Our crack is completely\n null of these issues with SKIDROW's loader approach.  The  game  starts  up\n quite considerably faster and has no mention of  xlive  problems  with  our\n crack being used.\n\n We have also included a source code of how Skidrow's pathetic  approach  to\n this game was implemented.\n\n For those interested in viewing this its included here:\n\n #include \n static LPVOID address = 0x0DAC2EE;\n static STARTUPINFOA si = {0};\n static PROCESS_INFORMATION pi = {0};\n static DWORD dwOldProtect = 0;\n static SIZE_T numberOfBytesWritten = 0;\n static DWORD dwPatch1 = 0xC69259E9, dwPatch2 = 0xEC8B55FF;\n static DWORD dwOrig1 = 0x56525153, dwOrig2 = 0xEC8B5557;\n\n\n int __declspec( naked ) WinMainCRTStartup()\n {\t\n /* opens TDFerrari_O.exe by memory. */\n CreateProcessA(&quot;TDFerrari_o.exe&quot;, NULL, NULL, NULL, FALSE, 0x4080414, NULL, NULL, &amp;si, &amp;pi);\n VirtualProtectEx(pi.hProcess, &amp;address, 8, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &amp;dwOldProtect);\n /* opens TDFerrari_O.exe by memory. */\n WriteProcessMemory(pi.hProcess, (LPVOID)0xDAC2EE, &amp;dwPatch1, 4, &amp;numberOfBytesWritten);\n /* Offset 0xDAC2F2 to be patched with bytes EC8B55FF */\n WriteProcessMemory(pi.hProcess, (LPVOID)0xDAC2F2, &amp;dwPatch2, 4, &amp;numberOfBytesWritten);\n VirtualProtectEx(pi.hProcess, &amp;address, 8, dwOldProtect, &amp;dwOldProtect);\n /* Process runs */\n ResumeThread(pi.hThread);\n /* waits for window name &quot;Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends&quot; */\n while (!OpenMutexA(MUTEX_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, &quot;Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends&quot;))\n Sleep(1);\n /* Suspends process */\n SuspendThread(pi.hThread);\n VirtualProtectEx(pi.hProcess, &amp;address, 8, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &amp;dwOldProtect);\n /* Offset 0xDAC2EE to be patched with bytes 56525153 */\n WriteProcessMemory(pi.hProcess, (LPVOID)0xDAC2EE, &amp;dwOrig1, 4, &amp;numberOfBytesWritten);\n /* Offset 0xDAC2F2 to be patched with bytes EC8B5557 */\n WriteProcessMemory(pi.hProcess, (LPVOID)0xDAC2F2, &amp;dwOrig2, 4, &amp;numberOfBytesWritten);\n VirtualProtectEx(pi.hProcess, &amp;address, 8, dwOldProtect, &amp;dwOldProtect);\n /* Process resumes */\n ResumeThread(pi.hThread);\n /* Loader closes /*\n ExitProcess(0);\n }\n\n\n Game information:\n =================\n\n Test Drive: Ferrari is the ultimate driving  experience  for  fans  of  the\n Ferrari brand.
