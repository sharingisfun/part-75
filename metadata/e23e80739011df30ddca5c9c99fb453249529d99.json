Janie\n\nBy Matt Jones\n\nSo, my mind was blown this week.\n\nBecause I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know anything about anything, I had no idea that Chris Carrabba was in a couple bands before Dashboard Confessional (again he goes unnoticed). One of those bands was a little alternative/emo outfit called Further Seems Forever. Although he was only with them for their first album, The Moon Is Down, the band went on to garner a respectable following, put out another couple of good releases, and break up in 2006. Well, fast forward to 2012 and Further Seems Forever are back together as a band with Carrabba again as their frontman. The results are in, and they are good.\n\nWhat a difference 11 years makes!\n\nI dunno, man. It kinda sounds like Dashboard just decided to go a little harder and run CarrabbaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice through some weird filter, but it sounds awesome. Like, maybe The Dangerous Summer had some creative input on a Dashboard album. Or, like, the AFI kids in your high school (you know who IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m talking about) decided to grow up a little and go straightedge, and this is the music they listen to now.\n\nEither way, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m all over it. Ã¢â‚¬Å“So ColdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CanyonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are pretty much the runaway favorites here. They go well with nippy breezes and scarves.\n\nAngst, angst, angst, guitars, vague symbolism. Gah I love it.\n\nAll I can say is that if you like what you hear, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to love the rest of the album. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little front-loaded, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a small price to pay for the triumphant return of FSF with CC at the helm again. And hey, if you also didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know anything about anything before today, welcome to the club. This is Hands Down the best Carrabbalbum to come along since Dusk and Summer and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still plenty of room to get on board.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e23e80739011df30ddca5c9c99fb453249529d99","amp;dn":"Further+Seems+Forever+-+Penny+Black+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e23e80739011df30ddca5c9c99fb453249529d99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,62,128,115,144,17,223,48,221,202,92,156,153,251,69,50,73,82,157,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
