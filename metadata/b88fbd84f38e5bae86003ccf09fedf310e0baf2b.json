This series was in fact the first manga written by a western script team (Alan Grant and Tony Luke) and illustrated by a Japanese artist. 'Psychonauts' started in 1987 and was an initiative of Gene Pelc, head of Marvel in Japan, who wanted to make a cross-cultural hit. \n\nIn the year 2199, the council of the space cities of the Sol system send a team of six telepaths back to Earth to see if it is yet habitable again.\n\nMuch love to the creative team and scanners.
