In early 2013, Scott sold the tape to adamsribs, who passed it on to fellow Provider Module forum member Cringeon, who went on to rip and remaster the audio.\n\nSeveral songs have different or additional lyrics when compared to the official album equivalents: Angel with the Scabbed Wings, Antichrist Superstar, Minute of Decay, Mister Superstar and The Beautiful People. Astonishing Panorama is very different from the official version. Piss in the Wound (originally Crippled Groom) is an unreleased song - not to be confused with the Dungeon Master/Teen Dabbler song. Irresponsible Hate Anthem is a full demo, as opposed to the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdevelopment versionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that was previously leaked. Likewise, the version of Antichrist Superstar here is previously unreleased, and is different from the version leaked to the internet recently. Tourniquet cuts off at 2:51. Little Horn is not on the cassette, despite being listed on the back. Scott plays guitar and wrote Wormboy Gets His Wings, Irresponsible Hate Anthem, Antichrist Superstar, Mr. Superstar, Man That You Fear, Tourniquet, Piss In The Wound, and Suicide Snowman. The unreleased tracks are part of what is known as the Spooky Kids catalog.\n\nIn addition to the tape, we have included some additional demos. One of the demos is Heaven on the Brain. Heaven on the Brain is musically related to the song Antichrist Superstar, this track was intended to be the intro for the eponymous album. Inspired by the Jesus Christ Superstar tune &quot;Heaven On Their Minds&quot; (original album recording features Stevie Ray Vaughn).\n\nAntichrist Superstar Demos\nSide A\n- 01 D Is For Dirty (Apple of Sodom)\n- 02 Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes\n- 03 Angel with the Scabbed Wings\n- 04 Minute of Decay\n- 05 Wormboy Gets His Wings (Wormboy)\n- 06 Irresponsible Hate Anthem\n- 07 Antichrist Superstar\n- 08 Mister Superstar\n- 09 Man That You Fear\n- 10 P is for Porno (Deformography)\n- 11 Tourniquet (cut)\nSide B\n- 12 The Beautiful People\n- 13 Suicide Snowman\n- 14 Little Black Spots (Cryptorchid)\n- 15 1996\n- 16 Smells Like Children (Kinderfeld)\n- 17 Piss In The Wound\n- 18 Man That You Fear (Version 2)\n\nAdditional Demos (not included on the source tape) \n- Antichrist Superstar (Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ94 Demo) \n- Heaven on the Brain (320)\n- Heaven on the Brain (from Scott)\n- Irresponsible Hate Anthem (Development) \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.providermodule.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.providermodule.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.echoingthesound.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.echoingthesound.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe5354f33a90201b55b155e69bb432a7d553e5a","amp;dn":"Marilyn+Manson+-+Antichrist+Superstar+Demos+-+Remastered+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe5354f33a90201b55b155e69bb432a7d553e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,229,53,79,51,169,2,1,181,91,21,94,105,187,67,42,125,85,62,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
