King. During those 23 years, the Drifters music evolved from R&amp;B doo-wop to main stream rock and roll and then to soul, matching the evolution of popular music. The liner notes are well written and full of interesting details on the Drifters history, especially the succession of lead singers. \n(review,\n\n- - -\n\nDrifters - Rockin' and Driftin' 1953-1976\n(3CD Rhino Records 1996)\n\n 1.
