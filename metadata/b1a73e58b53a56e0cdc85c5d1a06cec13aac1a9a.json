This controversy about the nature of mind which persists to the present day raises many questions.This book first presents the final exposition of special insight by Tsong-kha-pa, the founder of the Ge-luk-pa order of Tibetan Buddhism in his medium-length Exposition of the Stages of the Path as well as the sections on the object of negation and on the two truths in his Illumination of the Thought: Extensive Explanation of Chandrakirti's Supplement to Nagarjuna's &quot;Treatise on the Middle.&quot; It then details the views of his predecessor Dol-po-pa Shay-rap Gyel-tsen, the seminal author of philosophical treatises of the Jo-nang-pa order as found in his Mountain Doctrine followed by an analysis of Tsong-kha-pa's reactions. By contrasting the two systemsÃ¢â‚¬â€Dol-po-pa's doctrine of other-emptiness and Tsong-kha-pa's doctrine of self-emptinessÃ¢â‚¬â€both views emerge more clearly,contributing to a fuller picture of reality as viewed in Tibetan Buddhism. Tsong-kha-pa's Final Exposition of Wisdom brilliantly explicates ignorance and wisdom, explains the relationship between dependent-arising and emptiness, shows how to meditate on emptiness, and explains what it means to view phenomena as like illusions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a73e58b53a56e0cdc85c5d1a06cec13aac1a9a","amp;dn":"Tsong-Kha-Pa%27s+Final+Exposition+of+Wisdom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1a73e58b53a56e0cdc85c5d1a06cec13aac1a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,167,62,88,181,58,86,224,205,200,92,93,26,6,206,193,58,172,26,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
