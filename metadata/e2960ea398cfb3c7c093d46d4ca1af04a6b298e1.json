Mystery Twins may only be in the first year of their career, but Lehmann and Brush have been playing together as one half of Nashville band The Clutters since 2001. This time, the pair have stripped not only the songs, but the instrumentation down to the core. Both share vocal duties, blending seamlessly into one voice, while the lack of a bass accents Brush's Wall of Sound drums.\n\nTheir debut E.P. &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; finds the two venturing through six songs that, while leaning towards 60's pop and early Rock &amp; Roll via the Everly Brothers, still holds an edge that recalls bands like The Velvet Underground or Modern Lovers. &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; was released on iTunes, Bandcamp, and Cassette on May 8th, 2012. \n\n\nMinimalist chemistry, harmonizing, thumping and loud-quiet-louding their way through first-generation R&amp;B and rock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll tunes and originals alike.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ D. Patrick Rodgers / Nashville Scene\n\nLehmann and Brush have a talent for raggedy harmonies that meld together well.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Lance Conzett / Nashville Scene\n\nWhat we like most about these guys is the haunting The Dutchess and the Duke vibe they have going, but of course, with a bit more of a punch.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ The South Rail\n\n\nThey have a sense of melody thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s somber, sweet and ornery all at once.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Jessica Pace / Music Connection Magazine\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2960ea398cfb3c7c093d46d4ca1af04a6b298e1","amp;dn":"Mystery+Twins+-+Love+Is+Strange+EP+-+320kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2960ea398cfb3c7c093d46d4ca1af04a6b298e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,150,14,163,152,207,179,199,192,147,212,109,76,161,175,4,166,178,152,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
