Complete automation is the objective. The bot is designed to automatically walk around and carry out battles! It will always be 100% free! No surveys, no Ad.fly, no Rapidshare!\n\nScreenshots and videos will be up in less than 12 hours. \n\nFeatures\n-------------------------------------------\n\n-Autoroam\n-Autobattle\n-Autolevel (Bot will pause when a Pokemon learns a new move)\n-Timing safeguard\n-Antiban techniques\n-Supports ALL resolutions\n-Select which attacks you want to use!\n-Works almost anywhere =D\n-Great for EV training, automatically runs away from predetermined Pokemon!\n\nDesigners\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a collaborative project between zydratex and I. zydratex and I will be programming additional builds weekly. We will never sell the bots. I learned AHK in four days to make this bot. A PokeMMO bot that costs 99 cents is 99 cents too much. \n\nzydratex and I encourage those who enjoy PokeMMO to pay for donator status. Servers aren't free, and the dev team works very hard to keep the game fun, so please support the developers!\n\n\n\nChangelog (1.5)\n+ Runaway Feature\n+ Updated documentation\n+ Improved PokeHome =)\n= Bug fixes while in battle.\n\nVersion: 1.04 \nSize: 1.82 MB\n\n\nPlease make sure your controls are configured to WASD for movement and SPACE/LSHIFT for A/B respectively. I'm working on a fix to this. It'll be fixed soon.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81a16098b645b2bb06467c711b13bfe21ed54b18","amp;dn":"PokeMMOBot-+MMO+Bot%2FGrinder%2FTrainer+%7C+1.05+RELEASED%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81a16098b645b2bb06467c711b13bfe21ed54b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,161,96,152,182,69,178,187,6,70,124,113,27,19,191,226,30,213,75,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
