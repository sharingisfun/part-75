Blue Jungle\n02. Sometimes I Dream\n03. My Home Is In The Street\n04. When It Rains It Pours\n05. Me And Crippled Soldiers\n06. Under The Bridge\n07. Lucky Old Colorado\n08. Driftwood\n09. Never No Mo' Blues\n10. A Bar In Bakersfield\n \n________________________________________\n\nMerle Haggard has a long history of singing patriotic songs but never \nhas he been more powerful or politically incorrect than on the \ncontroversial &quot;Me and Crippled Soldiers.&quot; This anti-flag burning song \nhas been praised by President George Bush and loved by millions at his \nlive concerts. Unfortunately it came out after country radio stopped \nplaying singers who had passed their 40th birthdays, so it wasn't the \nhit it should have been.\n\nTwo other cuts, &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; and &quot;My Home is in the Street&quot; subtly \nsupport Merle's political statement. These tales of down-on-their-luck \nindividuals seem to suggest that Washington DC's powers-that-be could \nhave more important things to do that outrage the people who send them \nthere and pay their salaries.\n\nThe rest of the CD is composed of solid Merle. Nothing else has the \neloquence or sinew of &quot;Me and Crippled Soldiers&quot; but every song warrants \na few listens.\n\n-- Amazon\n________________________________________\n\nRipped with : \n\nEAC 1.0b1\nSecure Mode\nTest &amp; Copy\nFlac 8\n\nAll artwork is also included \nin 600 dpi scans in PNG\n____________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea4ea9ceec00e4483cc90c469ad59fef003cee5","amp;dn":"Merle+Haggard+-+Blue+Jungle+%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea4ea9ceec00e4483cc90c469ad59fef003cee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,164,234,156,238,192,14,68,131,204,144,196,105,173,89,254,240,3,206,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
