He has been part of the Police VA3 Firearms Department, then of the Tactical Aid Group (known as the T.A.G.) before transferring to the VO8 Firearms Department. Gun Law tells the action-packed inside story of hard target, armed policing on the streets of Britain and the men who daily risk their lives in pursuit of criminals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65b46a4ff0a612bf175fa85ceaa8a58cdb0bab19","amp;dn":"Andy+Hailwood+-+Gun+Law+%28Mobi+%2B+Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65b46a4ff0a612bf175fa85ceaa8a58cdb0bab19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,180,106,79,240,166,18,191,23,95,168,92,234,168,165,140,219,11,171,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
