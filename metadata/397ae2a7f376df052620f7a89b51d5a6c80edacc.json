King John refused to tolerate his disobedience and sent the loyal Hugh de Lacy across the Irish Sea to defeat him.\n\nDe Courcy's castle was rebuilt, and much of its replacement is still standing. But the experts are convinced that some of what remains dates from de Courcy's time, and the archaeologists set out to find the lost structures.\n\nAs they survey and dig within the huge castle walls, the Team are in for a big surprise. It seems the site was occupied by tribal chiefs for many centuries before anyone had even heard of the Normans...\n\n\nPlease seed..If Channel 4 don't want to keep Time Team Alive, then we should....\n\n...My 1st Attempt at a video conversion....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:397ae2a7f376df052620f7a89b51d5a6c80edacc","amp;dn":"Time.Team.S20E09.Xvid.%28PsPXXX+TV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"397ae2a7f376df052620f7a89b51d5a6c80edacc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,122,226,167,243,118,223,5,38,32,247,168,155,81,213,166,200,14,218,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
