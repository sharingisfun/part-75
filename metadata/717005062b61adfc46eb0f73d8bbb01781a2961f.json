This is Chan Elite 1.9.1 tested for iOS 4, 5 and 6. It does crash every now and then, but it's definitely better than the mobile site 4chan has for example. \n\nIt has been removed from the official App store. I have no idea whether or not this will work on jailbroken devices.\n\nAll credit goes to the devs at Legendary Software Labs.
