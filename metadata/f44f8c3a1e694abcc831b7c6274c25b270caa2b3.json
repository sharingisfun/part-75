An Eastern Arrernte and Kalkadoon desert woman, Hetti is senior curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, daughter of political activist Charles Perkins and sister of filmmaker Rachel Perkins (First Australians, Bran Nue Dae). \nWith great generosity, she shares her extraordinary knowledge of Aboriginal art, visiting the homes and studios of artists in remote desert communities, the tropical top end, and in urban environments. She also brings personal anecdotes to the fore, recalling her family's own story, and her father's legacy: &quot;Art for me is a way for our people to share stories and allow a wider community to understand our history and us as a people.&quot; \nPast and present, tradition and modernity, the imagination and individual experiences of artists, converge. Art + Soul views Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art through a political prism, which allows for a richer appreciation of the artworks? And thereby of Aboriginal Australia and the life forces that underpin it. The series celebrates the survival and resilience of a whole culture.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Dreams and Nightmares \nFrom the 'dreaming' to the unsettling nightmare of colonisation, what is the role of memory, dreams and the spirit world in Aboriginal art? HJ Wedge was born in 1957 on the Erambie Mission in Cowra, Wiradjuri country in New South Wales, where he lives today. Wedge's work is distinctive in its bold use of colour and contemporary subject matter, which often deals with social and political issues relevant to Aboriginal people living in an urban context. He studied at Eora College TAFE in Redfern, Sydney, and first showed his work with fellow Aboriginal artist Ian Abdulla at Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative in Sydney in 1991. In 1993, Wedge was artist-in-residence at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, and following the residency his works were represented in an exhibition. His paintings were also among those selected for the 1993 Australian Perspecta, a biennial survey of contemporary Australian art at the Art Gallery of New South Wales; Urban focus, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, 1994; and the National Gallery of Australia's inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial, Culture warriors, 2007.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img228.imageshack.us/img228/5209/artandsoultheworldofabo.jpg&quot;
