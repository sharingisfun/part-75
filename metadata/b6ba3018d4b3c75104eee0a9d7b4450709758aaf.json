Yet humble fishermen had no problem whatsoever. This hard hitting sermon shows us why.\nmarkwoodman.org\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Do I Know There Is A God  by R G Lee:\nR.G. Lee was always and preeminently a preacher of the gospel of Jesus Christ. His sermons were eloquent and often long. Lee had no problem poking fun at himself about his hour to hour and half sermons. He often told this story on himself: &quot;Once at Bellevue a man came in late for the service. I was in the midst of my sermon. In a whisper he asked the usher, 'How long has he been preaching?' 'About forty years,' was the answer. 'The he must be about through.'&quot; Few remembered the length of Dr. Lee's sermons as nearly as much as they did their depth.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHumanism  A Fools Religion:\nAlan Batten said in a 1984 paper in the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, &quot;My impression is that many of the biologists who write about evolution for the ordinary public are committed in their minds to the belief that the question 'Why?' has no answer.... [They believe] evolution is purposeless, and life and Man have arisen only by chance. ... this is a legitimate belief for a person to hold, but that it is required by the scientific evidence is highly questionable. To hold it as such is as much an act of faith as to maintain the opposite.&quot;\n\nBatten encourages evolutionists to stop arguing scientific evidence with creationists, saying, &quot;I believe we shall achieve much more by frankly admitting the limitations of scientific research and concede that even creationists are raising legitimate questions.&quot;\nAlan H.
