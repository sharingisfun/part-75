Whether or not one aspires to be a songwriter, musicianship can only be enhanced by understanding the music that we play from the inside. However, becoming a songwriter or improving your songwriting is an unparalleled artistic achievement for the musically inclined. It is a journey into your soul; an expression of your being.\n\n1-2-3 Songwriting teaches you how to find and develop your own process for writing great songs. Ravi will teach you how to generate story ideas, chord progressions, or turn that riff gnawing away in your mind into a sonic masterpiece that will make you proud. Best of all, this process is fun, yet sometimes challenging, but always rewarding. By the end of this course you will have at least three new songs, at least three different writing processes, and a blueprint for the rest of your songwriting journey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a842739aed139abf5a13448bc124d20092546a","amp;dn":"1-2-3+Songwriting+%28truefire.com%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a842739aed139abf5a13448bc124d20092546a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,168,66,115,154,237,19,154,191,90,19,68,139,193,36,210,0,146,84,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
