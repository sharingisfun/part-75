Following the phenomenal success of Does Anything eat Wasps - the Christmas 2005 surprise bestseller - this new collection includes recent answers never before published in book form, and also old favourites from the column's early days. Yet again, many seemingly simple questions turn out to have complex answers. And some that seem difficult have a very simple explanation. New Scientist's 'Last Word' is regularly voted the magazine's most popular section as it celebrates all questions - the trivial, idiosyncratic, baffling and strange. This new selection of the best is popular science at its most entertaining and enlightening\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction 1\n1 Our bodies 3\n2 Feeling OK? 33\n3 Plants and animals 47\n4 Food and drink 77\n5 Domestic science 119\n6 Our planet, our universe 145\n7 Weird weather 167\n8 Troublesome transport 175\n9 Best of the rest 199\nIndex 233","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f8c73ae7772a20e095809590439d27397942c31","amp;dn":"+Why+Don%27t+Penguins%27+Feet+Freeze%3F+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f8c73ae7772a20e095809590439d27397942c31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,140,115,174,119,114,162,14,9,88,9,89,4,57,210,115,151,148,44,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
