They recorded under a variety of different names, including the Arkansas Travelers, The Red Heads, The Louisiana Rhythm Kings, The Charleston Chasers, The Six Hottentots, The Hottentots and Miff Mole and his Little Molers. The band's style was often called &quot;Chamber Jazz&quot; by critics and for what it lacked in hot intensity it made up for with a cool somewhat detached, yet urban and sophisticated sound. In 1959 Hollywood made a highly fictionalized movie about the band called &quot;The Five Pennies&quot;, starring Danny Kaye as Red Nichols. \n\n\n     &quot;Everybody Loves My Baby&quot;, also known as &quot;Everybody Loves My Baby, but My Baby Don't Love Nobody but Me&quot;, is a popular and jazz standard song composed by Spencer Williams in 1924. Lyrics were written by Jack Palmer. One important early recording was a young Louis Armstrong's, with Clarence Williams' Blue Five on November 6, 1924, New York, NY . The Boswell Sisters recorded a version of this song in 1932. Glenn Miller and the AAFTC Orchestra released the song as V-Disc 223A in July, 1944.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7941e00481f541c847e90290a0091ef412901619","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+460","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7941e00481f541c847e90290a0091ef412901619","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,65,224,4,129,245,65,200,71,233,2,144,160,9,30,244,18,144,22,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
