Hebrew Nephilim, meaning &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;causing to fall&quot; (Gen. 6:4). These were the violent tyrants of those days, those who fell upon others. The word may also be derived from a root signifying &quot;wonder,&quot; and hence &quot;monsters&quot; or &quot;prodigies.&quot; In Num. 13:33 this name is given to a Canaanitish tribe, a race of large stature, &quot;the sons of Anak.&quot; The Revised Version, in these passages, simply transliterates the original, and reads &quot;Nephilim.&quot;\n\n(2.) Hebrew rephaim, a race of giants (Deut. 3:11) who lived on the east of Jordan, from whom Og was descended. They were probably the original inhabitants of the land before the immigration of the Canaanites. -------------------------------------\n\nFabricated History:\nCharles Lawson 07/29/12 (SS) Genesis 5:1-2 Archeological Finds Which Confirm the Bible Are Ignored by Today's History Books -- To What End?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat does the Grand Canyon Indicate?
