Erase your Internet activity tracks and digital fingerprints. Protect your privacy and improve your system performance.\n\nALERT! YOUR PC PRIVACY IS AT RISK\nDid you know that Windows maintains an Ã¢â‚¬Å“unseenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ history of all of your PC activities, including files you have opened, websites visited, e-mails sent, logins and passwords, etc? It is important to understand that even having taken steps to Ã¢â‚¬Å“deleteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ files, cookies, search terms, browser history, etc., your data and activity remains on your PC Ã¢â‚¬Å“unseen. This leaves a history of all of your PC activity available to anyone who may currently have or someday gain access to your computer, be it family, employer, colleague, legal, PC maintenance, shared network, wireless network, or hacker sources. In addition, when you are on the Internet, you may have downloaded intrusive devices such as cookies, bugs, and spyware onto your computer. The intrusive devices may strike at any time.
