We  developed our own language, as lovers do. We had a game where we referred to each other as &quot;Pete,&quot; but preceded by another &quot;P&quot; word. Like, &quot;Oh, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be such a Presumptuous Pete&quot; or &quot;YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a real Prickly Pete lately.&quot; My grandfather is fond of saying, &quot;For the love of Pete!&quot; when we exasperate him. Since the album is a collection of love songs I wrote for my Past Pete, the phrase seemed fitting.\n\nExplanation of Album Artwork: For the Love of Pete features photos of Jenny and I in the backyard and neighboring farm of our Lincoln, RI residence. You wouldn't know it by our expressions, but we'd been broken up for several months at the time of that shoot. She not only took most of the photos, but also did much of the layout and typography.\n\nTracks:\n\n1 \t\tI'm Not So Proud \t\t4:28\n2 \t\tYou Should Sleep \t\t3:52\n3 \t\tTiny Triggers \t\t\t3:53 \t\n4 \t\tWhy Wake Up \t\t\t2:39 \t\n5 \t\tGood Manbaby \t\t\t3:39 \t\n6 \t\tCecilia \t\t\t1:40 \t\n7 \t\tI Tried \t\t\t2:13 \t\n8 \t\tBad Rabbits \t\t\t3:36 \t\n9 \t\tOn The Eighth Day \t\t2:36\n10 \t\tWeathervane \t\t\t2:00\n11 \t\tRest Now \t\t\t2:58\n12 \t\tHibernatal \t\t\t4:08 \n\n\nIf you enjoy this recording, please please do support the man who's been distilling himself into these very sounds since 1995.
