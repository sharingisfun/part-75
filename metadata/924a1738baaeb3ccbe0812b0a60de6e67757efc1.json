Side A: consists of\n11 tracks from what I understand to be the Black Ark Demos, Side B: are 3 tracks from the '79 Wounded Lion\ncessions. I have an 11 minute Ride Natty Ride that may also be a partial track to this cession, but not from this tape.\nSo I did not include here. Further, it sounds different (source ?) so I can post at a later date.\n     \nSide A:\n\n1. Who Colt The Game #1 3:30\n2. Who Colt The Game #2 version 3:38\n3. I Know A Place 4:09\n4.
