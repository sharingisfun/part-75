However, even at the time \nthese productions were criticised for being class-bound and living in the past. \n\nJournalist and historian Simon Heffer argues that these films have real \ncinematic merit and a genuine cultural importance, that they tell us something \nsignificant not only about the 1950s Britain from which they emerged but also \nabout what it means to be British today.\n\nHis case is supported by interviews with stars including Virginia McKenna, \nSylvia Syms and Sir Donald Sinden, with further contributions from directors \nGuy Hamilton (The Colditz Story) and Michael Anderson (The Dam Busters).\n\n----\nFile|\n----\n\nMovie (AVI) Name ..: BBC Fifties British War Films Days Of Glory 2013.avi \nTotal Size Bytes ..: 734,926,204 Bytes \nLength.............: 58:51.720 \nType...............: AVI(.AVI) \n\n-----\nVideo|\n-----\n\nCodec Code ........: XVID\t\nCodec Name ........: XviD 1.1.2 Final\t\nBitrate ...........: 1536 \nResolution ........: 624 x 352 \nAspect Ratio ......: 1.773 \nFramerate .........: 25.000 \n\n-----\nAudio|\n-----\n\nCodec Name ........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nBitrate ...........: 128 KB/s (CBR) \nChannels ..........: 2 \nSampling Rate .....: 48000 Hz \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4291efed6ee5a0bb7ba0b800ee9933fc1e696ee0","amp;dn":"BBC+Fifties+British+War+Films+Days+Of+Glory+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4291efed6ee5a0bb7ba0b800ee9933fc1e696ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,145,239,237,110,229,160,187,123,160,184,0,238,153,51,252,30,105,110,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
