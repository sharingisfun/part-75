Molisch, renowned researcher and educator, has put together the comprehensive book, Wireless Communications. The second edition, which includes a wealth of new material on important topics, ensures the role of the text as the key resource for every student, researcher, and practitioner in the field.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Professor Moe Win, MIT, USA\nWireless communications has grown rapidly over the past decade from a niche market into one of the most important, fast moving industries. Fully updated to incorporate the latest research and developments, Wireless Communications, Second Edition provides an authoritative overview of the principles and applications of mobile communication technology.\n\nThe author provides an in-depth analysis of current treatment of the area, addressing both the traditional elements, such as Rayleigh fading, BER in flat fading channels, and equalisation, and more recently emerging topics such as multi-user detection in CDMA systems, MIMO systems, and cognitive radio. The dominant wireless standards; including cellular, cordless and wireless LANs; are discussed.\n\n\nPlease seed after downloading","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f804f7fe1abdf994466cde9be6c7f5a89f595cb","amp;dn":"Wireless+communication+2nd+edition+Andreas+F.+Molish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f804f7fe1abdf994466cde9be6c7f5a89f595cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,128,79,127,225,171,223,153,68,102,205,233,190,108,127,90,137,245,149,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
