During 1987-1988, Oakenfold hosted a series of crucial club nights that introduced thousands of Brits to house music. Just a few years later, he helped push the new dance crossover into the charts by masterminding hit productions by Happy Mondays (among others) and forming one of the most successful dance labels of the 1990s, Perfecto Records. Even well over a decade after his emergence, Oakenfold remained, quite simply, dance music's most popular DJ.\n\n\n\n1   Breath the Life (Ivan Khurtin Remix) Evgeny Shagalov                 8:14 \n2   Love Me Deep Inside (Ilya Soloviev Progressive Remix) [feat.
