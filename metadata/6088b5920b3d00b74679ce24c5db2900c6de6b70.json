It was owned and operated by African Americans.\n\nVee-Jay was founded in Gary, Indiana, in 1953 by Vivian Carter and James C. Bracken, a husband-and-wife team who used their initials for the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name. Vivian's brother, Calvin Carter, was the label's A&amp;R man. Ewart Abner, formerly of Chance Records, joined the label in 1955, first as manager, then as vice president, and ultimately, as president.\n\nVee-Jay quickly became a major R&amp;B label, with the first song recorded making it to the top ten on the national R&amp;B charts.\n\nMajor acts on the label in the 1950s included blues singers Jimmy Reed, Memphis Slim, and John Lee Hooker, and rhythm and blues vocal groups The Spaniels, The Dells, and El Dorados. The 1960s saw the label became a major soul label with Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, Dee Clark, and Betty Everett putting records on both the R&amp;B and pop charts.
