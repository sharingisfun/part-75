This 30-minute film traces the history of Esperanto, an artificial language that was created in the late 1800s by a Polish eye doctor who believed that if everyone in the world spoke a common tongue, humanity could overcome racism and war. Fittingly, the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“EsperantoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ means Ã¢â‚¬Å“one who hopes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDuring the early 20th century, hundreds of thousands of people around the world spoke Esperanto and believed in its ideals. Today, surprisingly, a vibrant Esperanto movement still exists. In this first-ever documentary about Esperanto, Green creates a portrait of the language and those who speak it today that is at once humorous, poignant, stirring, and ultimately hopeful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a8becb08b1abdbf4b6bf31b1bb437f0abf3fdf","amp;dn":"Esperanto+-+The+Universal+Langugage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a8becb08b1abdbf4b6bf31b1bb437f0abf3fdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,168,190,203,8,177,171,219,244,182,191,49,177,187,67,127,10,191,63,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
