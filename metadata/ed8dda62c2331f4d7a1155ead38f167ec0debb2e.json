OOOPS? We all have and it can happen to anyone.\n\nUnblunder to the rescue!\n\nUnblunder uses Mac OS X's UNIX underpinnings to hang on to files after the Trash has been emptied. When started, it runs quietly in the background and stays out of your way.\n\nEssentially, Unblunder offers Mac OS X a much needed &quot;Recently Deleted&quot; feature, giving you plenty of time to recover files before they're gone forever. Note: for optimal file recovery and peace of mind, Unblunder needs to be running before an accident happens (i.e. trashing the wrong file).\n\nBy default, trashed files over 250 MB in size linger for 5 minutes and smaller files are kept for a day. Of course, you can tweak all these settings to match your work style at anytime.\n\nYou no longer need to bother with expensive, complicated file recovery software. Unblunder is much faster and more importantly, helps instantly recover your files exactly as they were when deleted -- not how they were an hour ago or a week ago.\n\nUnblunder gives you an extra cushion of assurance when working on your Mac.\n\nSome Key New Features in Unblunder:\n\n* Protects against accidental data loss.\n\n* Runs quietly in the background.\n\n* Easy access from the menubar.\n\n* Uses almost no system resources.\n\n* Instant recovery of recently deleted items.\n\n* A no-brainer to use.\n\n* Offer constant peace of mind.\n\n* Fully customizable.\n\n* and more!\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* New: Signed for Gatekeeper on Mountain Lion\n\n* New: Various tweaks, improvements, and fixes.\n\n* Other: This version drops support for PowerPC systems.\n\n* Other: Demo period reset for all users.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS version: X.6.8 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed8dda62c2331f4d7a1155ead38f167ec0debb2e","amp;dn":"Unblunder+v.+1.2.4+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed8dda62c2331f4d7a1155ead38f167ec0debb2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,141,218,98,194,51,31,77,122,17,85,234,211,143,22,126,192,222,187,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
