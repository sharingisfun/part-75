Lansdale\nArtist: Jack Jackson\n\n\nDark Horse proudly presents Joe R. Lansdale's cult novel, Dead in the West! Why dress up for Halloween as a cowboy, Indian, or walking corpse when you can see them mixing it up in East Texas, 1876? The residents of Mud Creek have trouble on their hands when only a down-on-his-luck preacher with a six-gun and a boy stand between the town and an army of the living dead, re-animated by an Indian shaman's curse. Jack Jackson is at the height of his form with Dead in the West -- his art gives a feeling of authenticity that perfectly complements the story and will leave you covered in goosebumps. For all fans of A Fistful of Dollars and Night of the Living Dead, this book is for you!\n\nEnjoy and seed!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c130603cba7e6f7c220305070882e89e77927834","amp;dn":"Dead+In+The+West+%28Complete%29+%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c130603cba7e6f7c220305070882e89e77927834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,48,96,60,186,126,111,124,34,3,5,7,8,130,232,158,119,146,120,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
