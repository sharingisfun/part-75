The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic clubmember, and for a time, a capable club president.\n\nInfo:\nAudio: En/Jap\nQuality: Medium/High\nSize/ep: 80Mb +/-\nEps:15\nEncoder: Frozen_Solid [F-D]\nFormat: .mkv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef6b49a39d6f6d8028976e81b0e972e2f5c5d30f","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5DGenshiken%5B480P%5D%5BDual-Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef6b49a39d6f6d8028976e81b0e972e2f5c5d30f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,107,73,163,157,111,109,128,40,151,110,129,176,233,114,226,245,197,211,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
