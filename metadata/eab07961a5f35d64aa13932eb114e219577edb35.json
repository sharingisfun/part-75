For her part, Holly is glad to leave the staid, official environs of the capital for the dining and atmosphere of New York, but her sojourn isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t only for pleasure. An explosive incident requires her immediate attentionÃ¢â‚¬â€and StoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigative expertise.\n\nBut what initially appears to be a clear-cut case soon becomes increasingly complexÃ¢â‚¬â€and dangerous. For in the secretive world of government intelligence, national interests all too often conflict with power grabs and turf wars, and extreme wealth allows even the most pursued rivals to slip through the cracks. As Stone and Holly follow the trail from LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s posh embassy district to ManhattanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Upper East Side, they learn just how well the most cunning plans can be disguised . . . and how far some people will go to wreak vengeance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab07961a5f35d64aa13932eb114e219577edb35","amp;dn":"Collateral+Damage+ebook+-+Stuart+Woods.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab07961a5f35d64aa13932eb114e219577edb35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,176,121,97,165,243,93,100,170,19,147,46,177,20,226,25,87,126,219,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
