She has followed her vision from the beginning to the end and the result is striking. After the critically acclaimed My Move and Moments Free she takes her artistic expression to a new level. In this project Christina works together with Calle Rasmusson, who's a member of Christina's band and who also works as an arranger with European orchestras and artists. Christina and Calle have arranged this album together in a very personal way.\n\nChristina Gustafsson was born in VÃƒÂ¤rmskog, Sweden, in 1970. She studied in 1994 - 96 at New York School of Music and 1996 - 99 at Kungliga MusikhÃƒÂ¶gskolan in Stockholm. Christina is well-established on the Swedish jazz scene and is one of Sweden's most celebrated jazz singers. As a composer she has gained a lot of attention during the years and in 2007 she was awarded the SKAP scholarship. Together with Rigmor Gustafsson, Christina was also awarded the Anita O'Day price in 2012 with the motivation: Rigmor and Christina Gustafsson belong to the elite among European female jazz singers.
