Use your own little Cubemen to defend your base from other little Cubemen that are trying to run it over. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the usual story, but with many very interesting twists. \n\nPlay a purely Defense game in various modes on a sweet selection of levels, or go into Skirmish mode and play a new type of TD game against either the computer or another human opponent. \n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right.. Two way REAL-TIME TD against the computer or a real person! \n\nThere are no static towers, just little men! Spawn your little Cubemen with orders to get to a certain location to attack or defend. You can move your Cubemen around the board at any time or click on an enemy to target them. \n\nCubemen Multi-Player games are cross platform, so you can play iPad v.s Steam or Steam v.s MAS or MAS v.s iPad... lots of Cubemen Multi-Player goodness! \n\nGame Specs:- \nÃ¢â€“Â  35 Defense Levels \nÃ¢â€“Â  25 Skimish Levels (AI &amp; Online Multiplayer) \nÃ¢â€“Â  8 Mayhem Levels (AI &amp; Online Multiplayer) \nÃ¢â€“Â  6 Defense Gameplay modes \nÃ¢â€“Â  Brand new Cubemen customisation screen \nÃ¢â€“Â  Individual score ladders for all Defense levels \nÃ¢â€“Â  Comprehensive stats and scores ladder for all game types \nÃ¢â€“Â  44 Achievements to earn in game\n\nRated 9.4/10 on Desura!\n\nCheck out the trailer...\n\nChanges in 1.27\n- Significant networking fixes/improvements \n- Fixed the &quot;Win All Defense Levels&quot; achievement from not being awarded\n\nChanges in 1.26\n- Improved level editor name checking to prevent potential database corruption. \n- Updated to newer Twitter and Facebook libraries, so Facebook connectivity now works again. \n- Updated to newer Unity Game engine build with lots of bug fixes \n- Fixed the Boss enemy unit from not being able to fire it's weapon. \n- Reduced game memory requirements slightly. \n- Other minor bits &amp; bobs\n\nThe latest version of one of the best indie games I have ever played.
