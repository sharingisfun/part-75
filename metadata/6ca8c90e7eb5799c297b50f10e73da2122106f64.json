This course focuses on mixing and mastering dance music.\n \nFollowing on from the DVD Production Series Volume 2: Trance, comes the long awaited tutorial on mixing and mastering the trance track Sunset. This 3 hour video course is designed to be used in conjunction with the Dance Music Manual (first or second edition) and follows Phiadra as they continue to mix and master the track they produced throughout Volume 2.\n\nThe screen recording software was left running throughout the entire mixing and mastering process, so nothing is missed out and the DVD also contains all the audio channels from the original track allowing you to follow and develop upon the techniques used and discussed throughout. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca8c90e7eb5799c297b50f10e73da2122106f64","amp;dn":"Dance+Music+Production+Vol.3%3A+Mixing+and+Mastering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca8c90e7eb5799c297b50f10e73da2122106f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,168,201,14,126,181,121,156,41,123,80,241,14,115,218,33,34,16,111,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
