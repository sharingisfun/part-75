He's in a hospital. He can't move. He can't remember who he is. Memories begin to flood back to him as he regains consciousness. He was part of a heist gone wrong. One of a crew of six asked to steal a briefcase from a secret vault. But that's all he can remember. He will combat the drugs and the pain and the solitude in a desperate effort to remember what happened to him and why. But once he finally reaches the end of his quest for answers he will wish he never began.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac59f82ee205313a3d263ed137cd8a0a5baf00b","amp;dn":"The+Day+Hollywood+Died+-+Announcement+Trailer.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac59f82ee205313a3d263ed137cd8a0a5baf00b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,197,159,130,238,32,83,19,163,210,99,237,19,124,216,160,165,186,240,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
