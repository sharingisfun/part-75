Unlike most, it isn't simply a gathering of &quot;classic texts&quot; but rather uses a great number of mostly brief writings gathered around several major themes, thus creating an implicit dialogue among anarchists and their critics.\n\nIt's worth noting that back in 1966 a major publisher like Doubleday was actually willing to issue a book such as this directed at the general public. Today it would never happen.\n\nback cover:\nIt is the aim of this book to clarify and analyze the various traditions that together make up the corpus of anarchist thought and inform anarchists' recommendations for the renovation of society.Grouping writings by past and present libertarians, both European and American, around topics of central interest to all of them, the editors have illuminated both the variety and the underlying unity of anarchist traditions. One section brings together criticisms that anarchists of different schools have made of socialism, defining the distance that separates anarchism from a movement with which it has often been mistakenly confounded. Another portion of the book is devoted to critiques and proposals relating to education, a field of great concern to libertarian thinkers and one inwhich their ideas have utomost relevance today. And, to facilitate a just appraisal, the editiors have included a number of cogent attacks upon various anarchist positions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73f60ce373628c815541619fd1617fed356f1b27","amp;dn":"Patterns+of+Anarchy%3A+Writings+on+the+Anarchist+Tradition+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73f60ce373628c815541619fd1617fed356f1b27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,246,12,227,115,98,140,129,85,65,97,159,209,97,127,237,53,111,27,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
