Davey\nGillen (Brian Milligan) is an IRA volunteer who is sentenced to Belfast's\n infamous Maze prison, where he shares a cell with fellow IRA member\n Gerry Campbell (Liam McMahon). Like most of the IRA volunteers behind \nbars, Gillen and Campbell are subjected to frequent violence by the \nguards, who in turn live with the constant threat of assassination at \nthe hands of Republicans during their off-hours. Campbell and Gillen are\n taking part in a protest in which they and their fellow IRA inmates are\n refusing to wear standard prison-issue uniforms as a protest against \nBritain's refusal to recognize them as political prisoners, a move that\n is complicating their efforts to pass information among the other \nprisoners. As the protest fails to get results, one IRA member behind\n bars, Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender), decides to take a different \ntack and begins a hunger strike, refusing to eat until Irish officials\n are willing to acknowledge the IRA as a legitimate political organization\n. However, while Sands' protest gains the attention both inside prison \nwalls and in the international news, not everyone believes what he's \ndoing is right, and Sands finds himself verbally sparring with a priest\n (Liam Cunningham) who questions the ethics and effectiveness of the \nstrike. \n\nFile Name: Hunger2008.avi\nFile Size (Bytes): 732,692,480\n\n[Format]\nFormat (Short Name): avi\nFormat (Long Name): AVI format\nDuration: 01:32:00.00\nDuration (Microseconds): 5,520,000,000\nBit Rate (bits/sec): 1,061,873\nNumber of Streams: 2\n\n[Metadata]\nencoder: VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n\n[Stream #0]\nType: Video\nCodec (Short Name): mpeg4\nCodec (Long Name): MPEG-4 part 2\nCodec Tag: 0x44495658\nCodec Tag (String): XVID\nCodec Time Base: 1/25\nTime Base: 1/25\nReal Base Frame Rate: 25/1\nAverage Frame Rate: 0/0\nDuration: 00:00:00.00\nDuration (Microseconds): 138,000\nBit Rate (bits/sec): N/A\nNumber of Frames: 138,000\n\nWidth: 640\nHeight: 272\nPixel Aspect Ratio: 1:1\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 40:17\nPixel Format: yuv420p\nHas B Frames: Yes\n\n[Stream #1]\nType: Audio\nCodec (Short Name): ac3\nCodec (Long Name): ATSC A/52A (AC-3)\nCodec Tag: 0x00002000\nCodec Tag (String): [0] [0][0]\nCodec Time Base: 0/1\nTime Base: 1/24000\nReal Base Frame Rate: 0/0\nAverage Frame Rate: 125/4\nDuration: N/A\nDuration (Microseconds): N/A\nBit Rate (bits/sec): 192,000\nNumber of Frames: 132,479,232\n\nChannels: 2\nSample Rate (Hz): 48,000\nBit Rate: 16 bits (Integer)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6dd65624b154df9d5d3ba530e432358dcd2358b","amp;dn":"Hunger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6dd65624b154df9d5d3ba530e432358dcd2358b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,221,101,98,75,21,77,249,213,211,186,83,14,67,35,88,220,210,53,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
