Tommy Spencer(Fredric Lehne) was 10 years old when his father died in prison, and he promised his dying father to stay away from any fighting. Tommy is looked after and counseled by his uncle Matthew(Kenny Rogers), a local preacher and lumberman who faces daily temptations in trying to be a good role model. Tommy's promises keep him from volunteering for the military. He works two jobs to help on the home front and falls in love with the beautiful Becky(Largo Woodruff). Becky has rejected the attention of Jimmy Joe Gatlin(William Schreiner), a town bully who has enlisted in the army. When Jimmy Joe returns from basic training he's enraged to hear that Becky is engaged to Tommy and Jimmy Joe takes out his anger on Becky. Tommy must decide to honor his father's last wish or defend the honor of Becky. \n\n\nFormat:MP4\nAudio: English/AC3-5.1 Dolby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbc4045aed3921543f240c9b734f2122eafb26c0","amp;dn":"COWARD_OF_THE_COUNTY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbc4045aed3921543f240c9b734f2122eafb26c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,196,4,90,237,57,33,84,63,36,12,155,115,79,33,34,234,251,38,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
