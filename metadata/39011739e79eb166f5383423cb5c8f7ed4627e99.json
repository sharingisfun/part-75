Buy that shit. 5 star reviews. -@FrauFickenDammt\n\nNot for the faint of heart, Spank Material for the Clinically Insane is a collection of wildly inappropriate and delightfully offensive humor tweeted over a period of two years. Leaving out all the filler, minutia and @ replies (with the notable exception of those above), only the most vile and disgusting jokes remain to tickle and then saw your funny bone in half (while it still remains attached). Alright, so some of the filler is still in there, but nevertheless, nothing horrible about the human condition is left off the table. Racism, homophobia, murder, rape, domestic violence, celebrities and just about every other party favor is touched upon. If you don't feel bad for laughing, then you need psychiatric help. It's a psycholocaustocalyptic trip that will leave your mind cowering in the corner in the aborted fetal position.
