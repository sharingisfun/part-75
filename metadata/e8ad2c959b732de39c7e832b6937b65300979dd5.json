This is a band who are equally adept at Fabulous Thunderbirds-inspired hard rock numbers like, Shine and bluegrass influenced tunes such as Another Day.\n \nWith the 2010 release of their sophomore album Dark and Bloody Ground, Fifth on the Floor saw some additional line-up changes as Robin Polly and Chris Collins parted ways with band and were replaced by Aaron Graham in drums and Jason Parsons on bass.\n\nFifth on the Floor has built a rock-solid testament to honest music, with songs like Shine, On My Way, and The Fall. Having played nearly three hundred shows in four years, theyve honed their show to an unforgettable experience. They let their hair down, kick your ass, and, with any luck, you'll remember it in the morning","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8ad2c959b732de39c7e832b6937b65300979dd5","amp;dn":"Fifth+on+the+Floor+-+Dark+And+Bloody+Ground+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8ad2c959b732de39c7e832b6937b65300979dd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,173,44,149,155,115,45,227,156,126,131,43,105,55,182,83,0,151,157,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
