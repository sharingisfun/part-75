Inspired by \nthe experience, Larry decides to put on a musical \nof his own, which goes well until Dick literally \nmissteps. Instead of going to Marty and Debbie for \nhelp (as they have done many times before), the \nBird-Kersees risk exposing their true identities \nwhen they call 9-1-1.\n\n18/Very Slow\nEvolve... or die.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdd2512ce8307c46d1995e80d31f383797caf88f","amp;dn":"The.Neighbors.2012.S01E20.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION+%5BPublicHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdd2512ce8307c46d1995e80d31f383797caf88f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,210,81,44,232,48,124,70,209,153,94,128,211,31,56,55,151,202,248,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
