Even if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never held a gun before, author Jackson Landers can show you how to supplement your food supply with venison taken near your home. He addresses everything a new hunter needs to know: how to choose the correct rifle and ammunition, how to hunt effectively and safely, and what to do if something goes wrong. He includes chapters on field dressing and butchering after the kill, recipes for using the meat, and a chapter on the politics and psychology of hunting. Whether you hunt to be more self-sufficient, to eat the safest and most nutritious meat possible, to protect the environment, or to save money, this book is the perfect guide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e7fd0a815209c7d8f796fbd40861368e6257f61","amp;dn":"The+Beginner%27s+Guide+to+Hunting+Deer+for+Food+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e7fd0a815209c7d8f796fbd40861368e6257f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,127,208,168,21,32,156,125,143,121,111,189,64,134,19,104,230,37,127,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
