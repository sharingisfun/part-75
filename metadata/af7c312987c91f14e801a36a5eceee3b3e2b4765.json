The scene was set as a Trojan Horse in the pre-WW2 decade that the communists denounced in paranoiac hatred and fear.\n\nThe film demonstrates the disgusting and risky nature of crowd manipulation for political ends, and the diminished morals of the manipulators.\n\nThe &quot;Hannibal&quot; mention in the title of this Hungarian film is not the infamous barbarian general. Instead, it is Professor Hannibal (Erno Szabo) as meek and mild as his namesake was ruthless and savage. The story takes place in the 1930s, during the fascistic regime of Hungary's Admiral Horthy. Prof. Hannibal does his best to cope with an untenable situation, but is swept up (and swept over) by events. The film is at once an advocation and a condemnation of populist rule, demonstrating the dangers of the mob mentality when the purpose of the mob is forgotten.\n\nTrivia\n\nVoted as one of the &quot;12 Best Hungarian Films 1948-1968&quot; by Hungarian filmmakers and critics (&quot;Budapest 12&quot; in 1969 and then again as one of the &quot;12 Best Hungarian Films&quot; (&quot;New Budapest 12&quot; in 2000.\n\nReview:\n\nThis is the story of a shool teacher who becomes a momentary hero after having rescued a stuffed-bird from a school incident! In esence, he is the prototype of the small and insignificant man and this fact is to be generalized even by his name(Nyul - meaning &quot;rabbit&quot;- Bela).When he sees his name wriiten on the walls as all insignificants spiritual leader, who must go, we know there`s no way out for him, but the inevitable death!Heartbreaking and sad, but so real, in the same time! Don`t miss it!\n\nIF YOU HAVE FOLLOWED MY HUNGARIAN MOVIE POSTS ON EUTORRENTS.COM YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN TWO HALF-TIMES IN HELL,\n\n\n\nAND THE FIFTH SEAL.\n\n\n\nTHE DIRECTOR OF PROFESSOR HANNIBAL IS THE SAME PERSON, WHO MADE THE PREVIOUS ONES, ZOLTÃƒï¿½N FÃƒï¿½BRI.\n\nUPON WATCHING IT, ONE CANNOT HELP NOT TO HAVE A WEIRD FEELING THAT THIS FLICK IS ABOUT SOMETHING, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, ABOUT SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AS WELL. FOR THIS REASON ONLY, I MYSELF AT LEAST CONSIDER IT A CINEMATOGRAPHIC HAIKU OF THE RAREST KIND.\n\nENGLISH SUBTITLES ARE CUSTOM MADE, NEVER BEFORE POSTED ON ANY SITES, THEREFORE THIS ONE IS ANOTHER EUTORRENTS.COM EXCLUSIVE.\n\nENJOY!\n\nTechnical Specs\nSource: Internet, hellshare.com, subtitle: ypse\nGroup/Ripper: ThanxXx to the Original Ripper!\nVideo Format: AVI/XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 914 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps \nAspect Ratio: 8:7\nResolution: 512 x 384\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.122\nAudio Format: 0x0055 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate: 182.11 Kbps\nSampling rate: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af7c312987c91f14e801a36a5eceee3b3e2b4765","amp;dn":"Professor+Hannibal+%281956%29+Hannibal+tanar+ur+ENG+Sub+SWATura-OD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af7c312987c91f14e801a36a5eceee3b3e2b4765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,124,49,41,135,201,31,20,232,1,163,106,94,206,238,59,62,43,71,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
