PETE ROSE: HITS &amp; MRS. premieres Monday, January 14 at 10 PM ET/PT and follows Pete and Kiana as they blend their respective families and prepare for a new life together. \n\nPete and Kiana are happily engaged - but as with many couples, the road to a wedding isn't always smooth. This new modern family will experience all of the challenges other families face - and much more. Much younger than her soon to be husband, Kiana is a vivacious mother of two beautiful kids from a previous marriage, Cassie (14) and Ashton (11). This will be Pete's third go-around raising kids, as he brings four older children of his own into the mix - some of whom have reservations about Kiana's age and their upcoming nuptials. Together they will face the added challenge of determining where to lay down roots. With Pete living and working in Las Vegas, and Kiana and her two kids residing in Los Angeles, can they manage a long distance relationship under separate roofs in different cities? \n\nPete's legendary history with baseball further complicates their lives. Kiana and her family know very little about that part of his past and his side of the story behind the public problems he continues to face. Pete shares more about his rise to fame in - and infamous banning from - the sport he loves, lives and breathes. With the support of Kiana and her kids, his family and legions of diehard fans, Pete considers appealing to the commissioner again on reinstatement. PETE ROSE: HITS &amp; MRS. takes viewers along for the ride as he attempts to bring his new family together, celebrate his extraordinary career and live the life he's always wanted to have\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fbed6bc61823a2159e1a505c11a1b7325078d86","amp;dn":"Pete.Rose.Hits.and.Mrs.S01E01.Veorovenlo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fbed6bc61823a2159e1a505c11a1b7325078d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,190,214,188,97,130,58,33,89,225,165,5,193,26,27,115,37,7,141,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
