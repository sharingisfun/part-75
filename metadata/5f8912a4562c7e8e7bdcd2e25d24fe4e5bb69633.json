This doesn't include the game. This only contains a mod tool called Bootleg that's intended to be used to easily configure Final Fantasy 7 to how you want it. \n\nTo use this run the BFE.exe file to configure which mods you would like installed then the Bootleg executable will run and do all the work. Please make sure to install Final Fantasy 7 with a maximum installation otherwise it will not work. Also the Bootleg loader will automatically convert the 2012 version of Final Fantasy 7 into the 1998 version.\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to ask. Also you can go to Qhimm forums to find additional information about the Bootleg mod. \n\nAll thanks to Pitbrat from Qhimm for making Bootleg mod loader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f8912a4562c7e8e7bdcd2e25d24fe4e5bb69633","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+7+Mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f8912a4562c7e8e7bdcd2e25d24fe4e5bb69633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,137,18,164,86,44,126,142,123,220,210,226,93,36,254,78,91,182,150,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
