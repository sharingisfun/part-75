Worked out what I was doing wrong, 28 shots of vodka can really fuck up your reasoning. \n\nAnyway, only album this band released, which is a shame, I was surprised not to find it anywhere on here either. Noone remembers them, noone seems to have heard of them. The whole album defines a period in my youth though and I do believe it's a good album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:def965e0f020d613073c8a92e23b42650033d4b0","amp;dn":"Pressure+4-5+-+Burning+The+Process+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"def965e0f020d613073c8a92e23b42650033d4b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,249,101,224,240,32,214,19,7,60,138,146,226,59,66,101,0,51,212,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
