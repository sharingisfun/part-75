Not them. Do not be deceived. Fear is a Sin.\n\nDescription:\n\nWalter Veith - Total Transformation (2011):\nThis wonderful DVD series is the latest by Professor Walter Veith which includes 18 riveting new talks with Biblical interpretations on Typeology conscerning the &quot;Type&quot; and &quot;Anti-type&quot; as presented by the major and minor prophets of the Holy Bible.  Rarely discussed among other scholars, Prof. Veith presents an in-depth study of these ancient prophecies and how they relate to the modern church and events yet to come!  \n\nGodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s people are the antitype of the children of Israel. Their experience is our experience. Their condition is our condition. Their disobedience is our disobedience. Their lesson in the wilderness is our lesson in the wilderness. Their Laodicean state is our Laodicean state. Their rebellion is our rebellion.\n\nThe series by Professor Walter Veith addresses the concerns of many disheartened individuals in the Church and outside the Church. Those who are wishing to leave the Church and those who are refusing to enter the Church because of the condition of the Church will both find answers to their difficult questions.\n\nIt is a call to unity and affiliation. It is not a critique but a diagnosis of the ChurchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s condition. It will lift the spirits and encourage all who are sighing and crying in the Church.\n\n\n\nEphesians 5:11\n\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n\n           \n     \n:thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce336f2ac92ed8cc6768d28d07246c305a1a28b7","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+End+Times+-+16+-+Walter+Veith+-+Total+Transformation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce336f2ac92ed8cc6768d28d07246c305a1a28b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,51,111,42,201,46,216,204,103,104,210,141,7,36,108,48,90,26,40,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
