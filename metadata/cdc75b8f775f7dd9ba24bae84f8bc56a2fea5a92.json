This sleek, highly refined pocket computer comes with everythingÃ¢â‚¬â€cellphone, iPod, Internet, camcorderÃ¢â‚¬â€except a printed manual. Fortunately, David Pogue is back with this expanded edition of his witty, full-color guide: the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular iPhone book. The important stuff you need to know: The iPhone 5. This book unearths all the secrets of the newest iPhone. Taller screen, faster chip, 4G LTE Internet, thinner than ever. The iOS 6 software. Older iPhones gain Do Not Disturb, the new Maps app, shared Photo Streams, camera panoramas, smarter Siri, and about 197 more new features. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all here. The apps. That catalog of 750,000 add-on programs makes the iPhoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s phone features almost secondary. Now youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know how to find, manage, and exploit those apps. The iPhone may be the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coolest computer, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a computer, with all of a computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complexities. iPhone: The Missing Manual is a funny, gorgeously illustrated guide to the tips, shortcuts, and workarounds that will turn you, too, into an iPhone addict.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdc75b8f775f7dd9ba24bae84f8bc56a2fea5a92","amp;dn":"iPhone+5+The+Missing+Manual+6th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdc75b8f775f7dd9ba24bae84f8bc56a2fea5a92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,199,91,143,119,95,125,217,186,36,186,232,79,139,197,106,47,234,90,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
