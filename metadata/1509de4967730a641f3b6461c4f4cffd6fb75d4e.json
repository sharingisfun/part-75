The sub's captain, Commander Burt Habley, faces a court-martial by a Naval Board of Inquiry. He's rescued from this fate when he's chosen to lead a top secret mission back to tap a North Korean underwater communications cable. Habley must protect his boat and crew from this phantom submarine while completing a successful mission. His instincts tell him they're being followed and he begins to navigate the sub away from the original mission and into open waters drawing the phantom sub away from the U.S. fleet. This puts him at odds with his new by-the-book Executive Officer who eventually, with the help of the special missions team, takes command of the submarine and navigates back on course just as they are attacked again. \n\n\n\n01:36:49\n640x480\n29.97 FPS\n\n\nThis is uncut version with gay parts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1509de4967730a641f3b6461c4f4cffd6fb75d4e","amp;dn":"2005+Tides+Of+War+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1509de4967730a641f3b6461c4f4cffd6fb75d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,9,222,73,103,115,10,100,31,59,100,97,196,244,207,253,111,183,93,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
