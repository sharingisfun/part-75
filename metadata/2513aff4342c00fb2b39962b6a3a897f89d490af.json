Black Sabbath meets Black Flag, but with a healthy dose of originality and mania all their own. Kinghorse, their debut CD is a wild ride though screaching vocals, whoa-ho-ho chants, and crazy lyrics. \n\n  Tracks:\n  01. Freeze \n  02. Caged \n  03. Lay Down And Die \n  04. Brother Doubt \n  05. Greatest Gift \n  06. Red \n  07. Descend \n  08. As I Stand \n  09. Razor \n  10. Too Far Gone \n  11. Clayfist \n\nIf you like the album, buy it and support the artist!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2513aff4342c00fb2b39962b6a3a897f89d490af","amp;dn":"Kinghorse+-+Kinghorse+%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2513aff4342c00fb2b39962b6a3a897f89d490af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,19,175,244,52,44,0,251,43,57,150,43,106,58,137,127,137,212,144,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
