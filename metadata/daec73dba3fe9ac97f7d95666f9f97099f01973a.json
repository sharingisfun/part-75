Dalton (born Jill Lynne Byrem on October 13, 1946 in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania), is an American country and western singer and songwriter. She is known for her gritty, powerful vocals, which a People Magazine likened to a country equivalent to Bonnie Raitt. Dalton had a number of hits in the 1980s, including Ã¢â‚¬ËœTakin' It Easy,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœCrazy Blue EyesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ16th Avenue.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Though absent from the U.S. country charts since 1990, she still continues to record and perform, having most recently released three independently recorded albums, Wild Horse Crossing on Shop Records in 1999, The Last Wild Place, on Song Dog Records in 2004 and her 2010 self-released Here's To Hank available on her website lacyjdalton.com.
