The time has come for seven precious gifts, bestowed on the Earth by its guardian, to be revealed. The boy is charged by an Angel to find and understand them. He must read seven books whose stories hide the gifts.\n\nThe mysterious books defy our earthly sense of normal, and challenge even this boy's perception of reality as he seeks to unveil the secrets of the seven gifts; and the enigma of the Angel; and the reason for himself.\n\nWhen the books close, the gifts will be no longer hidden, the Angel no longer veiled; and the boy no longer a boy.\n\nAnd we no longer the people we were.\n\nSome reviewers have said: &quot;.. a great achievement&quot;; &quot;brilliant, wise &amp; funny .. lingers in the head like a piece of music&quot;; &quot;walks that fine line between profound and insane&quot;; &quot;It is really a wonderful, unique book&quot;.
