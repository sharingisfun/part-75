The music with Hamilton has been called\n\n&quot;chamber jazz;&quot; a label which is quite apt.\n\n\nCollette was a lyrical reedman and flautist as well as a gifted writer.\n\n\nThis album showcases his considerable skills as both a player and writer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16fd9229f434b06ab7dfea3ef89a42a771e05888","amp;dn":"NICE+DAY+with+BUDDY+COLLETTE+%281956%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16fd9229f434b06ab7dfea3ef89a42a771e05888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,253,146,41,244,52,176,106,183,223,234,62,248,154,66,167,113,224,88,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
