Sheets shot all three installments on video, included over 700 zombies in the first installment alone, and has a knack for combining audacious gore effects with hokey acting and slightly incoherent scripts. But no one is looking for great performances and finely honed screenwriting in Sheets's films; they're looking for blood and guts, and this collection provides plenty of shocking delights for the gore connoisseur.
