Therefore this workshop is recommended to those who have studied and worked with techniques from the Kathara levels 2-3 Program and The Revelations of Ra, Mexico 2004 workshop. In Mexico specific techniques were used to initiate the embodied Pillar of Power via Til-E-a' Nadradon Complex activation. In this UK workshop the Zandradon Photo-Flame Cell of the Ecka Base shield and Earth Indigo Tribal Shield initiates, the Breathing Tube within the Pillar of Power opens, the Sha-Na-TA Arcs are released from phase lock and the full '8 Breath of Reclamation' Breathing cycle initiates in Earth for the first time since 13,400BC. The Reu-Sha-TA Spiral within the Breathing Tube is restored to the Christiac imprint, over-riding the Graviton-Sextant Vortex Sustem. We expedite further the restoration of the personal and planetary Diamond Sun Anatomy by restoring individual Chakra Seed Crystal Seals to their natural Christiac Reu-Sha-TA coding via Reu-Sha-TA Vortex code induction. These workshop materials cover the meaning and unprecedented implications of these events and activations in terms of Personal, Planetary and Universal structures and the current Universal drama and why the incorporated techniques/ activations are so important in preparation for Planetary Kethradon Awakening, December 2004 - February 2005 and Planetary Pillar of Power Starburst during Hetharo- May 27th 2005.  Workshop materials include: Review of Kathara Level 3 including the Transcendent Phase of the Transduction-Manifestation Sequence and the Lotum, LotE, Loti, Lota and LotA crystal Body Light Grids; Review and further explanation of the Til-E-a' Sphere Refraction Screen and densification (phase 6) of the Transduction-Manifestation Sequence: Axi-A Tonal and Meridian 12-line sets and further detail on the Lotosphere, Magnosphere and Electrosphere. Explanation of Spark Pulse Currents; the Myonic, Dyonic and Eyonic Crystal Body and their vortice grids leading to a deeper understanding of Lotus Arcs; The Diamond Sun Body of the Krist - the 'Sun of God'; activating the Diamond Sun Body and Heliopathic Rays through Kathara Level 4 Techniques; Understanding how Eternal Life Force Current is regenerated through the Pillar of Power and Diamond Sun Crystal Body structure and switching on the ability for Life Force Spark Regeneration; Deeper understanding of the Eckasha Seed Atom  and the Matradon and Patradon seeds; Building the Pillar of Power and Reu-Sha-TA reset within the Pillar of Power Breathing Tube for eternal life phasing; explanation of the '8 Breath Athonitilea Breathing'; structure of Chakras as 4-way Reuche Vortice sets; Transmuting the Graviton Vortex system through 360 Reuche Pillar Starbursts.\n\n The 5 Zendradon Awakening Techniques: 'A-Sha-RA-Reu-Sha-TA-Khem-a-lo-ha-tea' initiation; Opening the Breathing Tube (the 8 Breaths of Reclamation); Releasing the Sha-Na-TA; Restoring the Reu-Sha-TA Spiral to the Christiac Imprint; Personal Chakra Polarity Restoration via Reu-Sha-TA Vortice Code Activation, included on accompanying CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f29dd8128a0b75471697bcd4fe246e8c4739d686","amp;dn":"The+U.K.+Michael-Mary+Line+Workshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f29dd8128a0b75471697bcd4fe246e8c4739d686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,157,216,18,138,11,117,71,22,151,188,212,254,36,110,140,71,57,214,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
