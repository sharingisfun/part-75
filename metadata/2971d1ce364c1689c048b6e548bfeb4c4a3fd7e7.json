I was missing the music scene to the point that I brought my ipod mini with me everywhere. I had it on that moment I realized that I was staring into a 60 inch plasma screen watching Alex Rodriguez round the bases over and over again.\n\nSo imagine being in a bar and they are playing some 80's crap song that never made it, while listening to your ipod in one ear, your friend in the other, while watching espn in 7 minute loops. \n\nI remembered:\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon and Wizard of Oz together.\n\nIt worked for me.\nIt inspired me to buy the dvd and album. I added TDSOTM as  audio tracks on the disc. I left out the menus, so the disc played on insert.\n\nWith a little research one will find the connections between free silver and the Wizard of Oz. So in that composition we clearly understand the musical movements, and their connections to the original film.\n\nWHAT EVER HAPPENED TO  //\\//\\-|-/? combines machismo on film with an sound track composed of underground electronic music of the moment. Or, what music television could be. More cinematic than tvish, this DVD will push the next VJ to release a mix to further push the envelope.\n\nDVD5 720 x 420i 16:9 Letterbox &lt;Anamorphic&gt; Mastered in 720x480p DV\nAudio PCM 16bit @ 48khz 126BPM Mastered in 24bit 96khz.\n(This disc is perfect for the Pioneer DVJ-X1 as the audio is PCM)\n2hrs 1min runtime.\n\nSome footage used:\nTron, The Fast and the Furious 1 and 3... no more spoilers;)\n\nThe Chapters:\n\n1) With my friends at WMC 06+07\n2) The Idiots have taken over Detroit\n3) Till death do us part\n4) Death\n5) Follow me\n6) I'll be there in your life\n7) Ballsweat\n8) I trusted you\n9) Ego Trip\n10) Are you ready?\n11) The internet is a series of tubes\n12) State of affairs\n13) Mtv is a no.\n14) London calling\n15) Mtv evil business\n16) It's time for a change\n17) Inner space\n18) Freedom at any cost\n19) Neela Drifts\n20) Revolution\n21) Climaxtic\n22) Rebuild\n23) Credits\n24) All I ever wanted\n25) Resistance\n26) Starting over\n27) Don't think\n28) The Cabaret Laws of New York\n\n\nThe Trax:\n\nThe \u0010Difference Machine\nSuper Skunk - Deadmau5 Remix\nIdiots - Audiojack Remix\nLucky Heather - Dubfire Remix\nHydrology - Original Mix\nMoan - Radio Slave's Acapella Breakdown\nHide &amp; Seek - TiÃƒÂ«sto's In Search Of Sunrise Remix\nSweep - Jim Rivers Vox\nIn Love With You - Mark Knight Tool Room Vox\nPut Your Hands Up for Detroit (Claude Von Stroke Packard Plant Remix)\nMouth to Mouth - Audion\nCarry Me Away feat Emma Hewitt Micky Slim - Funkagenda Spankd Mix\nReady To Go - Club Mix\nEverybody Freakin - Original Mix\nElementos Fugaces - Javith 's In Progresso Mix\nRoadkill Maurizio - Danyelino Remix\nMy MTV - FR3QNAST3 REDUB\nPerspective - Original Mix\nSpace - Klass Club Remix\nIntergalactic - Original Mix\nNeela Drifts - Brian Tyler\nWhite Label\nCallisto - Original Mix\nInstinto Primario - Original Mix\nEnjoy The Silence - Club Mix\nWhat You Feel - Jim Rivers Unreleased Dub\nSunburst - Original Mix\nDancing in Dark Rooms - Jim Rivers Remix\nThe Future Calls - FR3QNAST3 RE-MIXDOWN\n\nNext release Dec 14th, in time for Christmas Eve parties and New Years Eve!
