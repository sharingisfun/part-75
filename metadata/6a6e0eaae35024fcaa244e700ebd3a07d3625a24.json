James Wilby stars \nas Siegfried Sassoon, the real-life war hero and poet who, in 1917, writes \na statement against the war that is read in Parliament. Faced with the choice \nof either a court-martial or time in a mental hospital as a result, Sassoon \nchooses the hospital, and is sent to Craiglockart, a Scottish castle where \nshell-shocked vets are being treated by Freudian therapist Dr. William Rivers \n(Jonathan Pryce). Sassoon soon befriends a pair of fellow inmates. One, Billy Prior (Jonny Lee Miller) is suffering from battlefield trauma. The other is shy young fan and fellow poet Wilfred Owen (Stuart Bunce), whose own anti-war writings, encouraged by Sassoon, will go on to make him posthumously famous as well. In the meanwhile, the once-zealous Dr. Rivers begins to question his role of mending patients' minds so that they may simply go back to the front lines\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120001/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120001/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFile Name: Regeneration.avi\nFile Size (Bytes): 723,838,626\n\n[Format]\nFormat (Short Name): avi\nFormat (Long Name): AVI format\nDuration: 01:49:01.36\nDuration (Microseconds): 6,541,368,000\nBit Rate (bits/sec): 885,244\nNumber of Streams: 2\n\n[Metadata]\nencoder: MEncoder 2:1.0~rc2-0ubuntu19+medibuntu1\nISRF: DVD ripped by acidrip.sf.net\n\n[Stream #0]\nType: Video\nCodec (Short Name): mpeg4\nCodec (Long Name): MPEG-4 part 2\nCodec Tag: 0x34504d46\nCodec Tag (String): FMP4\nCodec Time Base: 1/25\nTime Base: 1/25\nReal Base Frame Rate: 25/1\nAverage Frame Rate: 0/0\nDuration: 00:00:00.36\nDuration (Microseconds): 163,534\nBit Rate (bits/sec): N/A\nNumber of Frames: 163,534\n\nWidth: 480\nHeight: 270\nPixel Aspect Ratio: 1:1\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nPixel Format: yuv420p\nHas B Frames: No\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a6e0eaae35024fcaa244e700ebd3a07d3625a24","amp;dn":"Regeneration+aka.+Behind+the+lines+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a6e0eaae35024fcaa244e700ebd3a07d3625a24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,110,14,170,227,80,36,252,170,36,78,112,14,189,58,7,211,98,90,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
