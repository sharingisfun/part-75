They're a very early Drone band that got their start in the late 60's. They're best remembered for Takehisa Kosugi, an amazing violinist, composer, and musician all together. In my opinion, he's one of the best to come from the Fluxus movement along with John Cale, Terry Riley, and Henry Flynt. \n\nAnyways, I wish I could get my hands on some of The Taj-Mahal Travellers' bootlegs, but the prices for them are just insane! Also included here along with the 3 &quot;Official&quot; albums is the &quot;On Tour&quot; video released in 2008 that contains footage of The Taj-Mahal Travellers during their 1972 tour.\n\nEnjoy!, and everything has a CBR of 320 as well; the quality of the &quot;On Tour&quot; video isn't anything to brag about though.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 ALBUMS + VIDEO\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1972 - July 15, 1972\n\n\n1974 - August 1974\n\n\n2008 - Live In Stockholm 1971\n\n\n2008 - On Tour (Video)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97957ce7e8dcd2d8655540040c1007974f742440","amp;dn":"The+Taj-Mahal+Travellers+Discography+%281972-2008%29+%5B%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97957ce7e8dcd2d8655540040c1007974f742440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,149,124,231,232,220,210,216,101,85,64,4,12,16,7,151,79,116,36,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
