In McDROID giant lasers talk, monster mutate and even your strawberries can turn against you and eat you Shuttle.\n\nIf the action is too frantic, put down those Teslas and let then link up and fry the Furry worms. Still too tough, bring up to 3 other friends to play co-op multiplayer. \n\nTurtle up, head-on fight, it's your choice, just don't let your crop rot away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1a35ce3a9d2ed0d07ba87f37e38add32577df88","amp;dn":"McDROID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1a35ce3a9d2ed0d07ba87f37e38add32577df88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,163,92,227,169,210,237,13,7,186,135,243,126,56,173,211,37,119,223,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
