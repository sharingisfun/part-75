The misunderstandings in short are as follows: i. hackers are portrayed as hoodlums; ii. the terms activists and cyber-terrorists are used interchangeably; iii. greater secrecy leads to greater security.  In this digital age, 'hackers' are seen to be more and more of a threat -- but to who? And what defines a 'hacktivist'? Would the leaderless movement, Anonymous, be seen as such? Krapp ties in this discussion of hacktivists to cyber-terrorism, security, freedom of speech, among other contentious topics today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:905cd2389ae553971476dae81b94153a92505425","amp;dn":"Terror+and+Play%2C+or+What+Was+Hacktivism%3F.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"905cd2389ae553971476dae81b94153a92505425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,92,210,56,154,229,83,151,20,118,218,232,27,148,21,58,146,80,84,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
