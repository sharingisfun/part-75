That one act changes the childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life forever.\n\nOdin Karussa grows up happy with the woodcutter, but throughout his youth his mind has always been set on becoming a knight, a protector of the people. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one problemÃ¢â‚¬â€œborn a mage and incapable of wielding his power, he hides his gift away from his adopted father. One night the woodcutter stumbles into their tent and discovers him using magic. His father is terrified by the revelation and strikes Odin down.  This act of betrayal is enough to force the fourteen year old Odin to flee to the capital and seek his fortune. OdinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magical abilites are discovered by a high mage and soon he is conscripted into the royal army to serve his king.\n\nOne stormy day, Odin is pulled from his afternoon classes and instructed to go to the courierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s officeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwhere, wrapped in parchment, a strange weapon has been delivered in his name. Shortly thereafter, panic ensues among the hierarchy when it is revealed that the weapon was created by the Drow. Fearing not only attack by the Drow, but that Odin is also a traitor, the court locks Odin within the castleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth tower, where only the most dangerous of villains are imprisoned. Will Odin ever become the knight he desires to be? \n\nA coming-of-age story about the power of might, perseverance, and the destinies that lie within us all, Blood begins a saga that follows one young manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey toward what everyone else has deemed impossible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37f9e4dab5ff7fd9f8267728158c197493e7aacf","amp;dn":"Blood-The-Brotherhood-1-by-Kody-Boye.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37f9e4dab5ff7fd9f8267728158c197493e7aacf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,249,228,218,181,255,127,217,248,38,119,40,21,140,25,116,147,231,170,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
