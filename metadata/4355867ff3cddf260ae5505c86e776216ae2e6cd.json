The file archiver and the settings can be entirely self-contained on the drive and then used on any Windows computer.\n\n\nLICENSE\n=======\nThis code is released under the GPL.  Within the 7-ZipPortableSource directory you will find the code (7-ZipPortable.nsi) as well as the full GPL license (License.txt).  If you use the launcher or code in your own product, please give proper and prominent attribution.\n\n\nINSTALLATION / DIRECTORY STRUCTURE\n==================================\nBy default, the program expects one of these directory structures:\n\n- &lt;--- Directory with 7-ZipPortable.exe\n\t+App\n\t    +7-Zip\n\t+Data\n\t\t+settings\n\nOR\n\n- &lt;--- Directory with 7-ZipPortable.exe\n\t+7-ZipPortable\n\t\t+App\n\t\t\t+7-Zip\n\t\t+Data\n\t\t\t+settings\n\nOR\n\n- &lt;--- Directory with 7-ZipPortable.exe\n\t+PortableApps\n\t\t+7-ZipPortable\n\t\t\t+App\n\t\t\t\t+7-Zip\n\t\t\t+Data\n\t\t\t\t+settings\n\nOR\n\n- &lt;--- Directory with 7-ZipPortable.exe (PortableApps, for instance)\n\t+Apps\n\t\t+7-ZipPortable\n\t\t\t+7-Zip\n\t+Data\n\t\t+7-ZipPortable\n\t\t\t+settings\n\n\nIt can be used in other directory configurations by including the 7-ZipPortable.ini file in the same directory as 7-ZipPortable.exe and configuring it as details in the INI file section below.  The INI file may also be placed in a subdirectory of the directory containing 7-ZipPortable.exe called 7-ZipPortable or 2 directories deep in PortableApps7-ZipPortable or Data7-ZipPortable.  All paths in the INI should remain relative to the EXE and not the INI.\n\n\n7-ZipPortable.INI CONFIGURATION\n=================================\nThe 7-Zip Portable Launcher will look for an ini file called 7-ZipPortable.ini within its directory (see the paragraph above in the Installation/Directory Structure section).  If you are happy with the default options, it is not necessary, though.  There is an example INI included with this package to get you started.  The INI file is formatted as follows:\n\n[7-ZipPortable]\n7-ZipDirectory=App7-Zip\nSettingsDirectory=Datasettings\n7-ZipExecutable=7zFM.exe\nAdditionalParameters=\nDisableSplashScreen=false\n\n\nThe 7-ZipDirectory and SettingsDirectory entries should be set to the *relative* path to the directories containing 7-Zip.exe and your settings from the current directory.  All must be a subdirectory (or multiple subdirectories) of the directory containing 7-ZipPortable.exe.  The default entries for these are described in the installation section above.\n\nThe SettingsFile entry is the name of your 7-Zip settings file within the SettingsDirectory.\n\nThe 7-ZipExecutable entry allows you to give an alternate filename for the 7-Zip executable.\n\nThe AdditionalParameters entry allows you to specify additional parameters to be passed to 7-Zip on the command line.\n\nThe DisableSplashScreen entry allows you to run the 7-Zip Portable Launcher without the splash screen showing up.  The default is false.\n\n\nPROGRAM HISTORY / ABOUT THE AUTHORS\n===================================\nThis launcher is loosely based on the Firefox Portable launcher, which contains methods suggested by mai9 and tracon of the mozillaZine.org forums.\n\nPlease Seed As Long As Possible\nThanks And Enjoy\nMajoruploader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4355867ff3cddf260ae5505c86e776216ae2e6cd","amp;dn":"7-Zip+Portable+%28Latest+Version%29%7EMajoruploader%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4355867ff3cddf260ae5505c86e776216ae2e6cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,85,134,127,243,205,223,38,10,229,80,92,134,231,118,33,106,226,230,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
