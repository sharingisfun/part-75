'Shadow Mode' redirects each system change to a virtual environment with no change to your real environment. If you experience malicious activities and/or unwanted changes, perform a reboot to restore your system back to its original state, as if nothing happened.\n\nWith Shadow Defender, you have the flexibility to specify which files and folders are permanently saved to the real environment. This ensures important files and folders are kept after a reboot.\n\nIf you want to make a maintenance-free computer, Shadow Defender will be your best choice.\n\n\nShadow Defender Features\n\n    1. Prevent all viruses and malwares.\n    2. Surf the internet safely and eliminate unwanted traces.\n    3. Protect your privacy.\n    4. Eliminate system downtime and maintenance costs.\n    5. Reboot to restore your system back to its original state.\n\n\n\nShadow Defender Users\n\n    1. Maintain a system free from malicious activities and unwanted changes.\n    2. Test software and game installations in a safe environment.\n    3.
