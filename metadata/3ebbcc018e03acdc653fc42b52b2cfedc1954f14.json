Jackie Gleason is razzing Toots Shor in Leo Durocher's box seats; J. Edgar Hoover, basking in Sinatra's celebrity, is about to be told that the Russians have tested an atomic bomb; and Russ Hodges, raw-throated and excitable, announces the game -- the Giants and the Dodgers at the Polo Grounds in New York. DeLillo's transcendent account of one of the iconic events of the twentieth century is a masterpiece of American sportswriting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ebbcc018e03acdc653fc42b52b2cfedc1954f14","amp;dn":"Don+DeLillo+-+Pafko+at+the+Wall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ebbcc018e03acdc653fc42b52b2cfedc1954f14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,187,204,1,142,3,172,220,101,63,196,43,82,178,207,237,193,149,79,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
