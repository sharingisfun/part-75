When Rosenthal joins forces with Hollywood studio Sony Pictures Television to recreate &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; for Russian TV audiences as &quot;Everybody Loves Kostya,&quot; he finds himself lost in Moscow, lost in his mission, lost in translation. Rosenthal tries to connect with his Russian colleagues but runs into unique characters and situations that conspire to drive him insane. The movie is a true international adventure, a genuine, &quot;fish out of water&quot; comedy that could only exist in real life.--(c) Samuel Goldwyn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:810a4af45f2642587bad9440fe13bcf8fb21971e","amp;dn":"Exporting+Raymond+%5B2010%5D+Making+Everybody+Loves+Raymond+in+Russi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"810a4af45f2642587bad9440fe13bcf8fb21971e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,10,74,244,95,38,66,88,123,173,148,64,254,19,188,248,251,33,151,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
