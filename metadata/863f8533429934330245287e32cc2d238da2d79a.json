With Batman back in the spotlight, the extended media coverage has awoken a far worse evil at Arkham Asylum, The Joker! Forever destined to be mortal enemies, The Joker has a diabolical scheme that may pull Batman down to the darkest levels of insanity. While on the horizon, a global catastrophe races towards Gotham and with it comes a familiar face, The Man of Steel, though this time he has Batman in his sights. Witness as the aging Dark Knight wages a tireless war against crime while proving that courage and will are indeed timeless.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863f8533429934330245287e32cc2d238da2d79a","amp;dn":"Batman%3A+The+Dark+Knight+Returns+Pt.2++mp4++SD%28itunes%2C+ps+3%2C+xbox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863f8533429934330245287e32cc2d238da2d79a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,63,133,51,66,153,52,51,2,69,40,126,50,204,45,35,141,162,215,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
