Even then, though, there were suggestions that the group - at the time, the duo of James Young and Aiden Whalley - were looking beyond the dancefloor for their kicks. Their mutant two-step experimented with floaty electronic textures and strived for a fuzzed emotional quality some way removed from familiar raving highs. Their debut album, 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s North, made this break explicit, as Young and Whalley employed a vocalist, James Buttery. They subsequently embarked on a new direction of chilly synth-pop - notable amongst these tracks was a take on The Human LeagueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (You Remind Me Of) Gold.\n\n  But News From Nowhere shifts the goalposts once again. In part inspired by George HarrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s My Sweet Lord, DarkstarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second finds the group jettisoning conventional verse-chorus structure and exploring mantric vocal repetitions. A bit like Animal Collective, in fact, who tracks like Amplified Ease or You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Need a Weatherman somewhat resemble. But DarkstarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gleaming, pristine electronics pull them some way from that particular groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wild canter through the experimental backwoods.\n\n  Instead, songs like Young Hearts and Hold Me Down employ techniques drawn from synth-pop, folktronica and the shimmering ambience of Eno collaborator Harold Budd. Their aim isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always true: Armonica ladles effects onto ButteryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal to cover up the paucity of its tune. But elsewhere, things come together quite beautifully. A DayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pay for a DayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Work opens with lead-like Pyramid Song piano, and slowly opens up into a sleepy-eyed mini-symphony, like an electronica Van Dyke Parks. Later, Hold Me Down is a lush tumble of ambient repetitions that closes the disc in gorgeous fashion. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re further from the dancefloor than ever - but Darkstar are picking up new tricks as they go.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe70db1101c9b47b80cbf8792fa57aac971510cd","amp;dn":"Darkstar+-+News+from+Nowhere+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe70db1101c9b47b80cbf8792fa57aac971510cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,112,219,17,1,201,180,123,128,203,248,121,47,165,122,172,151,21,16,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
