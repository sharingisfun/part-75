So I listened (and yes I am ashamed I totally missed him).\n\nSome Real old-school Folk and mostly poor recordings. However you can hear why he is an example for many promising singer song writers. So I selected - maybe not the best songs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but most certainly 30 of his best tracks. Ideal if you do not know John and quite pleasant if you just want to enjoy his music.\n\nThe best albums I found and I recommend are: On The Cobbles and The Church With One Bell. They sound quite good as well.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n\nDutch Treat - ^B042 God's Song (John Martyn)\n\n01 John Martyn - The Easy Blues\n02 John Martyn - Over The Hill\n03 John &amp; Beverley Martyn - Tree Green\n04 John Martyn - Pascanel\n05 John Martyn - Certain Surprise\n06 John Martyn - Solid Air\n07 John Martyn - Rock, Salt And Nails\n08 John Martyn - Back Down The River\n09 John Martyn - Walking Home\n10 John Martyn - He's Got All The Whiskey\n11 John Martyn - Baby Please Come Home\n12 John Martyn - Cool In This Life\n13 John Martyn - Ghosts\n14 John Martyn - Under My Wing\n15 John Martyn - May You Never\n16 John Martyn - Cobbles\n17 John Martyn - Wildflower\n18 John Martyn - Just Now\n19 John Martyn - One For The Road\n20 John Martyn - Spencer The Rover\n21 John Martyn - Sweet Little Mystery\n22 John Martyn - Glory Box\n23 John Martyn - Strange Fruit\n24 John Martyn - Small Town Talk\n25 John Martyn - One Day Without You\n26 John Martyn - Excuse Me Mister\n27 John Martyn - Hole In The Rain\n28 John Martyn - God's Song\n29 John Martyn - Death Don't Have No Mercy\n30 John Martyn - Send Me One Line [Live]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21cca00fc9325d0763f2104c44aadd188f2abcbf","amp;dn":"John+Martyn+%28Folk%29+-+God%27s+Song+%28Dutch+Treat+B042+VBR+MP3+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21cca00fc9325d0763f2104c44aadd188f2abcbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,204,160,15,201,50,93,7,99,242,16,76,68,170,221,24,143,42,188,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
