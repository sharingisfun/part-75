Magister Gaius, King Uther Pendragon's learned court physician to whom he's assigned as humble page, teaches him medicine, coaches his magical self-study, and warns him of Uther's strong aversion to magic. Merlin becomes servant and later friend to the noble but imprudent crown prince, Arthur, whose fate is linked with Merlin. In this, the fifth and final season, Arthur is now King of Camelot and the Druid boy, Mordred, is now a knight of the round table.  While Morgana is still on the loose looking for a way to bring down the reign of the Pendragons.\n\nenglish subs included in torrent\n\n\n\nPlease do not hit and run.  Seed so others may enjoy!\n\n\n*in episode 2 there is a short (maybe 10 seconds) stretch where there is no picture and only sound.  All the sources I found had this problem and I later found out it was a broadcasting glitch in the UK so nothing can be done","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81181fbfd521561a2fe24cd4fdfc9e22c924d2bf","amp;dn":"Merlin+5th+and+final+season+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81181fbfd521561a2fe24cd4fdfc9e22c924d2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,24,31,191,213,33,86,26,47,226,76,212,253,252,158,34,201,36,210,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
