Each session begins with a boy saying, &quot;Hi my name is Graham.&quot;\n\nThis set includes 4 DVDs. Each more advanced than the previous one. (Go in order...)\n\n\nThis program is awesome. My son has learned so many words from them, he really enjoys them and is saying / reading so many more words than anyone else we know his age.\n\nI do recommend getting the program, we have used the flash cards a lot and my son loves those as well. They really compliment the dvds. But these dvds are a great start, and once you see how much your child starts learning and doing from them, you might want to consider getting the flash cards, which is when you will see them really learning on how to read instead of just speaking.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14df67b8526c7fc2479295c8f01436b7f5f694a5","amp;dn":"Your+Baby+Can+Read","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14df67b8526c7fc2479295c8f01436b7f5f694a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,223,103,184,82,108,127,194,71,146,149,200,240,20,54,183,245,246,148,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
