Complete Season One (8 episodes from 2006)\n\nCapped from digital source with x264 codec.\n\nSeason one is not widescreen. These caps are PDTV, 720 x 544\n\nDragons Den went HD starting with season 2.\n\nAnd yes.. before anyone asks, I am also working on season 2.  And 3. And 4. \n\nI think seasons 5 and up are widely available in HD quality.\n\n\n---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---\n\n\nI believe season one is considered 'hard to find', so hopefully me releasing these caps will put an end  to that. \n\nDon't be a douchebag. Seed the files for at least a week after you download them.  Longer if possible. \n\nI won't bother uploading season 2 if there's a lot of 'hit and runs'\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dff50baef68a5f50f7d8365329882f4f6e47052c","amp;dn":"Dragons.Den.CA.Season.One.2006.PDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dff50baef68a5f50f7d8365329882f4f6e47052c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,245,11,174,246,138,95,80,247,216,54,83,41,136,47,79,110,71,5,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
