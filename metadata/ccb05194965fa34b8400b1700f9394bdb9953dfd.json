Except not desired at all! \n\nThe reason for this being an EP is that there aren't enough tracks to warrant it a full album in itself and the tracks that I could have added to these do not fit the style. Like 3.48 Shark. Does that fit? Nope. \n\nIt's also the shortest &quot;album&quot; I have ever made, being at a mere 8:43, not counting the instrumental. Comparing this to my other work, even demo tracks be longer. \n\nWhy is the cover name in Japanese? Because I was bored and I had John Lennon's son on my mind for some reason.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccb05194965fa34b8400b1700f9394bdb9953dfd","amp;dn":"Mundius+-+Fun+%282013%29+%28EP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccb05194965fa34b8400b1700f9394bdb9953dfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,176,81,148,150,95,163,75,132,0,177,112,15,147,148,189,185,149,61,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
