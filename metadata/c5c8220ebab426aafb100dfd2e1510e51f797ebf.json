Love's style is a synthesis of inner-city funk and folk-ish sensibility. One of the most difficult tasks for a musician is to find an apt label for her music; folk/funk, African/Appalachian, and House/Celtic have been bandied about for Laura Love. Whatever you choose to call it, Love's original music is at once fresh, def, and rooted in tradition. \n\nAlthough a popular headliner in her own right, she has opened for John Lee Hooker, Lyle Lovett, Bo Diddley, Karla Bonoff, and Elayne Boosler and been invited to perform at a number of folk and eclectic music festivals.\n\nHelvetica Bold\nOctoroon\nPangaea","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5c8220ebab426aafb100dfd2e1510e51f797ebf","amp;dn":"Laura+Love+-+3+cd%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5c8220ebab426aafb100dfd2e1510e51f797ebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,200,34,14,186,180,38,170,251,16,13,253,46,21,16,229,31,121,126,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
