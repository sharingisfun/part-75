Take your skills out of the 20th century and into this one with Dan Clark's accessible, quick-paced guide to C# and object-oriented programming, completely updated for .NET 4.0 and C# 4.0.\n\nAs you develop techniques and best practices for coding in C#, one of the world's most popular contemporary languages, you'll experience modeling a Ã¢â‚¬Å“real worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ application through a case study, allowing you to see how both C# and OOP (a methodology you can use with any number of languages) come together to make your code reusable, modern, and efficient.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a40e00597474a63a44056905697741df39db6c6e","amp;dn":"Beginning+C%23+Object-Oriented+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a40e00597474a63a44056905697741df39db6c6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,14,0,89,116,116,166,58,68,5,105,5,105,119,65,223,57,219,108,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
