Set in a world where martial arts battles and Eastern magic are commonplace, the series follows four young warriors in training that battle the forces of evil. They do this by protecting Shen Gong Wu (ancient artifacts that have great magical powers) from villains that would use them to conquer the world.\n\nOriginally airing on the Kids' WB block of programming on WB Network in 2003, the series ran for 3 seasons and 52 episodes. Typical episodes revolve around a specific Shen Gong Wu being revealed which results in both sides racing to find it. Episodes usually reach a head when one good and one evil character must challenge each other to a magical duel called a Xiaolin Showdown for possession of the artifact.\n\nA sequel series, titled Xiaolin Chronicles is expected to air on early 2013.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eea8fbacdf9184342a79938d601634a59486ad7e","amp;dn":"XIAOLIN+SHOWDOWN%5BSEASONS+1-3%5D%5BVERIFIED-VIDZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eea8fbacdf9184342a79938d601634a59486ad7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,168,251,172,223,145,132,52,42,121,147,141,96,22,52,165,148,134,173,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
