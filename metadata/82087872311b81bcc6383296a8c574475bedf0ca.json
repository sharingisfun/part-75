Nonironic Futuropolis will make you feel as magical as the first snowfall of winter. And Frog &amp; Fly is the quest for the Evil Toad Messiah. Together, this trilogy makes textbook reading for the serious Kochalka reader.\n\n'Magic Boy &amp; The Robot Elf'\nTop Shelf Productions, 2003, 92 pages\n\nMagic Boy is an old, decrepit man. Lonely and confused, he decides to build a robotic replica of himself. However, the robot goes insane and attacks his creator, then goes back in time, and kills his creator's childhood self. The robot then lives out the entirety of his creator's life in his stead. Space and time warp around Magic Boy and his Robot Elf, and fact and fantasy fracture and get shuffled together. This book reprints Kochalka's first (and highly ambitious) fever dream of a\ngraphic novel, and features an all-new ending that brings the story to a stunning psychedelic climax.\n\nWritten and Illustrated by James Kochalka\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82087872311b81bcc6383296a8c574475bedf0ca","amp;dn":"James+Kochalka+-+Magic+Boy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82087872311b81bcc6383296a8c574475bedf0ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,8,120,114,49,27,129,188,198,56,50,150,168,197,116,71,91,237,240,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
