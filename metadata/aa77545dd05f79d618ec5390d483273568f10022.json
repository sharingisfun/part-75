Now theres been so many faking them its now hard\nto know the truth and which if any are REAL but seems that\nscientists say some are real-see info.doc. (the trumpet one i believe are fake)\nhowever since I lived through a quake. indeed it had this massive\nsound like a jet plane/train noise mega decibels too so I believe\nthe earth can make these mysterious sounds\n\nI suspect some are sonic booms from the space like meteors and also\nmaybe the earth moving. 2011 was the lead up to  the quakes world wide\nand USA is way overdue\n\nthe sounds are still going as of feb 2013 (more fakes dont know)\n\nbut there was some new quakes lately and Meteorite flybys as well as\nfireballs reported in usa and the big one that hit Russia recently\n\n\nIF NOT LISTENED TO THE Coast to coast AM Weird sounds in a recent UFO\nBUNDLE i did .. grab it and have a listen as well. it talks about\nmuch of this collection\n\n\nEnjoy and HELP SEED!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa77545dd05f79d618ec5390d483273568f10022","amp;dn":"Weird+Sounds+-+UFOs%2CSkyQuakes%2CMeteors%2CEarthBooms+%282011-2013%29+xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa77545dd05f79d618ec5390d483273568f10022","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,119,84,93,208,95,121,214,24,236,83,144,212,131,39,53,104,241,0,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
