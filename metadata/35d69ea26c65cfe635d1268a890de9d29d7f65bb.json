What they don't know is that in 1979, in a cave under the house, there was a gay disco, which burned down when a foam machine short-circuited, and five bodies were never found. \nToday, the house is haunted by five gay ghosts. However, only Marc is able to see them, and his visions drive Emma away. The ghosts, touched by Marc's problems, do everything in their power to help him get his girl back.\n\nSwedish Hardcode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35d69ea26c65cfe635d1268a890de9d29d7f65bb","amp;dn":"Poltergay.2006.swesub.dvdrip.xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35d69ea26c65cfe635d1268a890de9d29d7f65bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,214,158,162,108,101,207,230,53,209,38,138,137,13,233,210,157,127,101,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
