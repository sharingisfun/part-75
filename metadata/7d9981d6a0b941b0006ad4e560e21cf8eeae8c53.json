Each episode of the new CTV Original Drama begins by revealing not only the victim, but the killer as well. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a Ã¢â‚¬Å“whodunit,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Ã¢â‚¬Å“whydunit,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a question faced by spirited female Vancouver homicide detective Angie Flynn (Kristin Lehman) as she begins to piece together the clues from the crime. How are the victim and killer connected? What is the motive? As the mystery unfolds, the audience navigates a complicated maze of clues alongside the detective and her team.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9981d6a0b941b0006ad4e560e21cf8eeae8c53","amp;dn":"Motive.S01E08.HDTV.x264-BAJSKORV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9981d6a0b941b0006ad4e560e21cf8eeae8c53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,153,129,214,160,185,65,176,0,106,212,229,96,226,28,248,238,174,140,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
