You can either use a really small on screen keyboard, or you can use the D2s hand writing recognition abilities. The second method is not always terribly accurate. People who have used a PDA will probably be quite familiar with hand writing recognition. \n\nThe Dictionary was added in firmware revision 3.40b.\n\nI have looked everywhere for the Cowon D2 version and have only been able to get the S9 version. I found this on my hard drive while cleaning up files and organizing. I am sure others are looking for this. I will keep seeding for up to a year or so. That will get a good base of seeders going from various audio forums hopefully.
