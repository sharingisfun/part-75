The roots of the band go back to singer/songwriter Molly Hamilton and drummer Michael Stasiak's time in the Tacoma music scene, where they contributed songs to a compilation label before heading to New York. In the summer of 2010, the pair began working on new music together and brought guitarist Robert Earl Thomas into the fold. Using a laptop microphone and GarageBand, the trio crafted a six-song cassette that autumn dubbed The October Tape. The eclectic indie label Captured Tracks signed Widowspeak and issued the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut single, Harsh Realm, in March 2011; the Gun Shy single -- which featured a cover of Chris IsaakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wicked GameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- followed in June. Meanwhile, Widowspeak recorded with Woods' Jarvis Taveniere, and released their self-titled debut in August 2011.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32f0992b3392c9825d5cc398a22ea85b5295749","amp;dn":"Widowspeak+-+2+Albums+%282011-2013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32f0992b3392c9825d5cc398a22ea85b5295749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,47,9,146,179,57,44,152,37,213,204,57,138,34,234,133,181,41,87,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
