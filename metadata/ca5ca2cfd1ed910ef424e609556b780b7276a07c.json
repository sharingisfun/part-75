While the routine decisions       \n   that shape our dayswhat to have for dinner, where to shop, how to get     \n   to workmay seem small, collectively they have a big effect on global      \n   warming. But which changes in our lifestyles might make the biggest       \n   difference to the climate? This science-based guide shows you the most    \n   effective ways to cut your own global warming emissions by twenty         \n   percent or more, and explains why your individual contribution is so      \n   vital to addressing this global problem. Cooler Smarter is based on an    \n   in-depth, two-year study by the experts at The Union of Concerned         \n   Scientists. While other green guides suggest an array of tips, Cooler     \n   Smarter offers proven strategies to cut carbon, with chapters on          \n   transportation, home energy use, diet, personal consumption, as well as   \n   how best to influence your workplace, your community, and elected         \n   officials. The book explains how to make the biggest impact and when      \n   not to sweat the small stuff. It also turns many eco-myths on their       \n   head, like the importance of locally produced food or the superiority     \n   of all hybrid cars. The advice in Cooler Smarter can help save you        \n   money and live healthier. But its central purpose is to empower you,      \n   through low carbon-living, to confront one of societys greatest threats.  \n\n  +-[ ALEXANDRIA ]----------------------------------------------------------+\n  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :\n  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :\n  : of the ancient world.
