On their second album, 'One Man Army', they aim for a sweetly emollient guitar sound and layer it with something distinctive, too. &quot;Driven by Fools&quot; here in original demo form, is essentially Barrie O'Neill's baritone and a disconsolate piano riff, but there's a bleakness to his voice that takes the song to a haunting place, which is certainly reminiscent of Fleet Foxes. &quot;Get By&quot; piles on Kings of Leon-ish raucousness, but the chorus is carried by four-part harmonies that emphasize how good their voices are together. &quot;Maybe I'll Find&quot; with it's warm, acappella chorus Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Maybe I'll find that I need you more than you'll ever need me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ may or may not be addressed to O'Neill's girlfriend, Lana Del Rey; either way, it's worth a listen.\n'One Man Army' is packed with soaring indie-pop songs, and the band, who took inspiration for their name from the classic 1969 movie 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', produce a bold and strong record!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eab57d2e81dc3c0008c018364cd538ebebf4607","amp;dn":"Kassidy+-+One+Man+Army+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eab57d2e81dc3c0008c018364cd538ebebf4607","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,171,87,210,232,29,195,192,0,140,1,131,100,205,83,142,190,191,70,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
