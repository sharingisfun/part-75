The robots were designed and created by robotics expert, Mark Setrakian (Hellboy, Men in Black), a leader in the sport of robotic combat.\n\nIn the premiere episode of Robot Combat League, the contestants are paired into 12 teams, comprised of a robo-jockey and a robo-tech. Each team is then introduced to its own unique robot, which they will control using a high-tech exo-suit that translates their exact movements to their robot. The contestants take control of the robots for the first time in a timed challenge to earn their rankings for the fight tournament. The top-ranked team and the bottom-ranked team then fight for their life in three rounds of non-stop mechanical carnage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b862eb8e39ab3e30d5af9c615a8a372f7c7219fd","amp;dn":"Robot_Combat_League-S01E01-Rise_of_the_Machines.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b862eb8e39ab3e30d5af9c615a8a372f7c7219fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,98,235,142,57,171,62,48,213,175,156,97,90,138,55,47,124,114,25,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
