All three also serve as head writers. It premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.[5]\n\nThe show is centered on five characters: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, two physicists employed at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.[6][7] Over time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist colleague at Caltech and, at different times, a lover of both Leonard and Howard; Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's fiancÃƒÂ©e (later his wife), a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit, and neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, who joins the group after surreptitiously being matched to Sheldon on a dating website.\n\nThe show, which is filmed in front of a live audience,[8] is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[9] In August 2009, the sitcom won the best comedy series TCA award and Jim Parsons (Sheldon) won the award for individual achievement in comedy.[10] In 2010, the show won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy, while Parsons won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.[11] On January 16, 2011, Parsons was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Comedy or Musical, an award that was presented by co-star Kaley Cuoco. On September 18, 2011, Parsons was again awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. On January 9, 2013, the show once again won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy, also winning the title in 2010.\n\nWhen the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, The Big Bang Theory ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18Ã¢â‚¬â€œ49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83 million viewers.[12] CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2011 schedule.\n\nOn January 12, 2011, CBS announced that the series had been renewed for an additional three years, extending it through the 2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14 season.[13] As of the 2012-13 television season, the series is in its sixth season, which premiered on September 27, 2012.[14]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a36c4e6e4b06344c368da6878a9ea195a50095e","amp;dn":"THE+BIG+BANG+THEORY+%5BSEASONS+1-5%5D%5BVERIFIED-VIDZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a36c4e6e4b06344c368da6878a9ea195a50095e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,54,196,230,228,176,99,68,195,104,218,104,120,169,234,25,90,80,9,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
