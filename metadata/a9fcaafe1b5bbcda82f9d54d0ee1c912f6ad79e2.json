Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9fcaafe1b5bbcda82f9d54d0ee1c912f6ad79e2","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23304+-+Andrew+Dice+Clay+%5B64k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9fcaafe1b5bbcda82f9d54d0ee1c912f6ad79e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,252,170,254,27,91,188,218,130,249,213,77,14,225,201,18,246,173,121,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
