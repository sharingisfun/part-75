I would describe it as a do-it-yourself kit for those who like to build and experiment, but not the typical home shelving or brick bar-b-q units for the back yard. Now if you like electronics, computers, experiments of all kinds, then you might want to take a look at these. Some examples of show titles are: Aerial kite photography, Computer Music Making, Kinetic Wave Sculpture, Steampunk, and more. Enjoy!\n\nCT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee7946e48042d49cf7d0923146ea40751d40d42f","amp;dn":"%27Make%27_Season_One_Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee7946e48042d49cf7d0923146ea40751d40d42f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,121,70,228,128,66,212,156,247,208,146,49,70,234,64,117,29,64,212,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
