It was directed by Lexi Alexander and stars Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam. In the United States and Australia, the film is called Green Street Hooligans. In other countries, it is called Football Hooligans or just Hooligans. In the film, an American college student falls in with a violent West Ham football firm (the Green Street Elite) run by his brother-in-law and is morally transformed by their commitment to each other.\nThe story and screenplay were developed by former hooligan turned author Dougie Brimson. Throughout the film, the Green Street Elite fight other &quot;firms&quot; such as Tottenham Hotspur's Yid Army, Birmingham City's Zulus, Manchester United's Red Army and Millwall's Bushwackers. A sequel called Green Street 2: Stand Your Ground, was released straight-to-video in 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecd20cf76331111d21bd40f9ba2cabc18205c461","amp;dn":"Green+Street+Hooligans%5B2005%5DDvDrip%5BGR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecd20cf76331111d21bd40f9ba2cabc18205c461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,210,12,247,99,49,17,29,33,189,64,249,186,44,171,193,130,5,196,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
