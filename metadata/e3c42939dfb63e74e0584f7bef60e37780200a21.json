The pair star as down-and-outs (very much their situation in reality at the time) who try to generate funds by providing an impromptu leisure tour in a rickety bus they wangle use of for free. Released in 1935 and rarely seen today, the film offers brief glimpses and hints towards methods Tati would begin to perfect on the big screen a decade later. \n\nRipped from a DVD-R made from a VHS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3c42939dfb63e74e0584f7bef60e37780200a21","amp;dn":"Gai+Dimanche","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3c42939dfb63e74e0584f7bef60e37780200a21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,196,41,57,223,182,62,116,224,88,79,123,239,96,227,119,128,32,10,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
