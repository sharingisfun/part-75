And that's the whole plot of this short, elegiac film where time flows like the waters of the river the boys follow, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes swirling back. Against the idyllic setting of undisturbed forest and crumbling temples, Krit woos his would-be lover and prays to the Buddha to help him. Vin, however, is afraid of being seen as gay yet is unwilling to reject his friend.\n\n\nEnglish hard-coded sub.\n\n\n00:53:27\n640x384\n23.976 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58ec6220c125b5b1bc54b385336a26829d8acdd5","amp;dn":"e+2004+Tam+Sai+Nam+%5BDown+The+River%5D+%28THA%29+%5BEngHSub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58ec6220c125b5b1bc54b385336a26829d8acdd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,236,98,32,193,37,181,177,188,84,179,133,51,106,38,130,157,138,205,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
