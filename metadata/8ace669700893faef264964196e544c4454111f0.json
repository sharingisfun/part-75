Payne's fine, easy-going performance made Bonner a very appealing western hero. Preferring to find peaceful resolutions to the problems he faced, Bonner was often given no choice but to fight and his proficiency with a gun made him a fearsome opponent to those who dared cross him. With a fine supporting cast, including guest appearances by Dan Blocker, James Coburn, Royal Dano, Claude Akins, Denver Pyle, Alan Hale. Restless Gun consistently ranked in the Neilsen Top Ten during its run. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050055/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050055/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy the show and thanks for choosing cOOt torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ace669700893faef264964196e544c4454111f0","amp;dn":"The+Restless+Gun+-+Vol.2+E01-08.DVDRip+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ace669700893faef264964196e544c4454111f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,206,102,151,0,137,63,174,242,100,150,65,150,229,68,196,69,65,17,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
