Callen is notable for being one of the original cast members on the sketch comedy series MADtv.\n\n-----------------\n\nThis is the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #307 64k Time Warped version. Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58724b2a941c7910a8f902c3841ecec63721856","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23307+-+Bryan+Callen+%5B64k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58724b2a941c7910a8f902c3841ecec63721856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,135,36,178,169,65,199,145,10,143,144,44,56,65,236,236,99,114,24,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
