Now that number is six. And Big Media may get even bigger, thanks to the FCCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s consideration of ending a rule preventing companies from owning a newspaper and radio and TV stations in the same city. Such a move Ã¢â‚¬â€ which theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried in 2003 and 2007 as well Ã¢â‚¬â€œwould give these massive media companies free rein to devour more of the competition, control the public message, and also limit diversity across the media landscape. Bernie Sanders, one of several Senators who have written FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski asking him to suspend the plan, discusses with Bill why Big Media is a threat to democracy, and what citizens can do to fight back.\n\nAlso on the show, Bill is joined by former Republican Congressman Mickey Edwards, a founding father of modern conservative politics who now fears the movement has abandoned its principles. Edwards explains why both political parties require radical change, and shares his perspective on Grover Norquist and anti-tax pledges. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not conservatism, not rational, not adult,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Edwards tells Bill. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a 12-year-oldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind of thinking.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Edwards chaired the Republican Policy Committee, was a founding trustee of the conservative Heritage Foundation, and served as National Chairman of the American Conservative Union.\n\nFinally, in an original essay, Bill Moyers says thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to NorquistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anti-tax pledge than ideology or principle.
