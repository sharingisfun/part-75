It's 2012 and anything goes. Bryan and David are a Beverly Hills couple and they have it all. Well, almost. With successful careers and a committed and loving partnership, the one thing missing is a baby. And just when they think the stars will never align, enter Goldie, an extraordinary young woman with a checkered past. A Midwestern waitress and single mother looking to escape her dead-end life and small-minded grandmother, Goldie decides to change everything and move to L.A. with her precocious eight-year-old daughter. Desperate and broke - but also fertile - Goldie quickly becomes the guys' surrogate and quite possibly the girl of their dreams. Surrogate mother, surrogate family.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cf000bf6652330ba5641494a6413586936139c0","amp;dn":"The.New.Normal.S01E22.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cf000bf6652330ba5641494a6413586936139c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,240,0,191,102,82,51,11,165,100,20,148,166,65,53,134,147,97,57,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
