Armed '\n '  with  only  his  trusty camera, Pic sets forth on his great adventure. A\n `  camera might not seem like enough for  a  puzzle  platforming adventure,\n .  but  this  camera is different from most: it has the ability to  capture\n    and remove from the world the very objects that it photographs. Not only\n .  that, but it can also use its powers to  paste  the  photos it took back\n    into the environment!\n .\n :  Everything that the camera captures is perfectly preserved, and when the\n |  photos are restored  the  objects are restored with it. On top of all of\n |  that, this amazing  camera  can  also  rotate  the photos before they're\n |  pasted. Take  a  picture of an incoming fireball, rotate it and paste it\n |  to send it flying into a wall of heavy boxes to knock it out of the way.\n |  See  what  kind  of crazy things can happen to Pic with his awesome (and\n |  probably magical) camera during the adventure of his life!\n |\n |  Features :\n |\n |\n |  Ã‚Âº A unique photography mechanic that lets you take a picture of the game\n |    world and paste it back in elsewhere.\n |  Ã‚Âº Over 100 different  levels  of  platforming  and  puzzling, 4 distinct\n |    environments  to  explore,   all  with  hand-crafted  high  resolution\n |    graphics.                                                              .\n |  Ã‚Âº Secrets  and  time trial challenges for every level ensure that you'll .\n |    never play the same way twice!                                         :\n |                                                                           |\n `._______....::::::::::.___________________________________________________.'\n  ..--''&quot;&quot;      .       :\n.'   .----------`-------'------ r e l e a s e notes -------------------------.\ni   i                                                                        '\n|   |  1# Unzip, Unrar manually.
