It is the fourth film released as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was directed by Kenneth Branagh, written by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne, and stars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan SkarsgÃƒÂ¥rd, Colm Feore, Ray Stevenson, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins. The film tells the story of Thor, the crown prince of Asgard, who is exiled from his homeland to Earth. While there, he forms a relationship with Jane Foster, a scientist. However, Thor must stop his adopted brother Loki, who intends to become the new king of Asgard.\n\nSam Raimi first developed the concept of a film adaptation of Thor in 2001, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in &quot;development hell&quot; for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel Studios signed Mark Protosevich to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance it and release it through Paramount Pictures. Matthew Vaughn was originally assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled into 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in California and New Mexico from January to May 2010. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.\n\nThor was released on April 21, 2011, in Australia, and on May 6, 2011, in the United States. The film was a financial success and received positive reviews from film critics. The DVD and Blu-ray sets were released on September 13, 2011. A sequel, Thor: The Dark World, is set for release November 8, 2013.\n\nStoryline\n\nThe powerful but arrogant warrior Thor is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard and sent to live amongst humans on Earth, where he soon becomes one of their finest defenders.\n::Release::\nRelease (India) - 29 April 2011 (India)\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh, Joss Whedon\nWriters: Ashley Miller (screenplay), Zack Stentz (screenplay)\nStars: Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman\n\n===========================================================\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Comedy\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Fantasy\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\nCodec ID : isom\nFile size : 519 MiB\nDuration : 1h 54mn\nOverall bit rate : 632 Kbps\nResolution : 720 x 304 pixels\nLanguage\t : Hindi/English\nSample : Included\nCover : Yes / Yes\nEncoded Date : 29-12-2012\nEncoded By : Utpal &amp; Jayant\n\n\n&quot;:VIDEO&quot;:\n\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;763b171f18363a455847&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 16 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 1h 54mn\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 304 pixels\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio\nAudio #1\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 1h 54mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 105 MiB (20%)\n\nAudio #2\nID : 3\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 1h 54mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 105 MiB (20%)\n\nCover:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img11/9391/thorcoverp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img11/9391/thorcoverp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img836/5730/thorcd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img836/5730/thorcd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nScreens::                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img18/3000/samplethor2011.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img18/3000/samplethor2011.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUploader:                                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/4747/uploadera.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/4747/uploadera.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/AshUtpal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/AshUtpal&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dbbee1cb95abf736314dfbb08d00c3b99b9a337","amp;dn":"Thor+%282011%29+BRRip+%5BDual+Audio+-+Hindi%2BEnglishi%5D+%7B500MB%7D+%5BUJ.rip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dbbee1cb95abf736314dfbb08d00c3b99b9a337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,187,238,28,185,90,191,115,99,20,223,187,8,208,12,59,153,185,163,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
