It follows the relationship between aspiring actor Logan Foster (Windham Beacham) and reformed drug dealer Gil Ramirez (Matthew Montgomery), two men who find themselves inexplicably drawn together despite their disparate backgrounds, and the fact that they both regarded themselves as straight. However, their bond is soon threatened by Gil's mysterious past and a startling revelation about the true nature of their connection. Neither man is prepared for this, nor the impact it will have on their lives. \n\n\n\n01:23:15\n640x352\n23.976 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f83a17299125e635c00b896b434c022cbd0a972","amp;dn":"2007+Back+Soon+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f83a17299125e635c00b896b434c022cbd0a972","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,131,161,114,153,18,94,99,92,0,184,150,180,52,192,34,203,208,169,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
