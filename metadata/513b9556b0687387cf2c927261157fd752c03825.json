Her mother is a compassionate soul who rents out several rooms in a self-owned building, which is occupied by very poor and nearly destitute people like Chandu - who sells Rotis for a living; Rammurthy - who sells milk; as well as Murari who is physically handicapped, and Manglu who is unable to find employment nor food for his wife and malnourished children. Seema's mom often ends up looking after her tenants financially and also gives them ample time to find money to pay the rent. While returning home from a picnic in Khandala, Seema ends up in the wrong train compartment and meets a young man by the name of Rajan. She finds out that he wants to rent a room in Bombay and asks him to approach his mother.\n\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\n\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 2:19:18\nSubtitles: English\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 2:19:18 \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:513b9556b0687387cf2c927261157fd752c03825","amp;dn":"Biradari+%281966%29+Xvid+2cd_Eng+Subs+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"513b9556b0687387cf2c927261157fd752c03825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,59,149,86,176,104,115,135,207,44,146,114,97,21,127,215,82,192,56,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
