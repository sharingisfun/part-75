Dechanet - Christian Yoga (Harper and Row, 1972). 246 pages.\n\nNew scan. Image pdf with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nDescription:\n\nFirst published in French as La Voice du Silence in 1956, this odd little book represents an early attempt by a Western Christian to take account of yoga. The author was a Benedictine priest and he includes in the book both an examination of yoga philosophy and Catholic philosophy and spiritual doctrine as it relates to yoga, and a practical program of hatha yoga practice. By today's standards it's a little crude, but the author is frequently very insightful. The book ends with an short examination of similarities between yoga and hesychasm, and includes some brief excerpts from the Philokalia.\n\nThe book is now out of print and not easy to find cheaply.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f32e8b6f8942a5f8593c69f3abba427537fd05c3","amp;dn":"J.-M.+Dechanet+-+Christian+Yoga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f32e8b6f8942a5f8593c69f3abba427537fd05c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,46,139,111,137,66,165,248,89,60,105,243,171,186,66,117,55,253,5,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
