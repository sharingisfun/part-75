When no one answered the door, she said he disappeared. St. ClairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother instructed her daughter to get her .40-cal. Glock pistol and go into a  bathroom closet. St. Clair heard him break in through the back door. As the man made his way through her home, 9-1-1 dispatchers kept St. Clair on the phone. He was inside the home for approximately six minutes before he made his way to the bathroom where St. Clair was hiding. When she saw the doorknob begin to turn, she fired the gun. The 32-year-old intruder was taken into custody after being treated for a gunshot to the chest. (The Oklahoman, Durant, Okla., 10/20/12)\n\n---\n\nTolon Labe!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2424ee265d7efdbf45acc4463951ede47dd4b95b","amp;dn":"NRA+America%27s+First+Freedom+mag+%28Jan+2013%29+-+spanikopita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2424ee265d7efdbf45acc4463951ede47dd4b95b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,36,238,38,93,126,253,191,69,172,196,70,57,81,237,228,125,212,185,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
