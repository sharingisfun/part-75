Having served less than one year they were released, thanks to a campaign by Bernard O'Mahoney, who having witnessed the trial was convinced a major miscarriage of justice had occurred. Following their release O'Mahoney sat down with the sisters to write a book about their ordeal and soon he and Michelle began an affair. His suspicions were, however, raised by Michelle's obsessive behaviour and when he tried to finish the affair he stumbled across an incriminating letter. After a confrontation Michelle confessed her guilt. The sisters fought for years in the high court to gag O'Mahoney, but he won. This volume tells the story of his two crusades, the first to prove the sister's innocence, the second to be allowed to tell the world of their guilt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6834a8b13651e2ea7fdf3d78aa4b987fa385df70","amp;dn":"Bernard+O%27Mahoney+-+The+Dream+Solution+%28Mobi+%2B+Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6834a8b13651e2ea7fdf3d78aa4b987fa385df70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,52,168,177,54,81,226,234,127,223,61,120,170,75,152,127,163,133,223,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
