Call it a MechWarrior clone, but some people like myself find this game in a league of it's own. I'm uploading this because it was a childhood favorite, and I could never find a torrent for it anywhere else. So my purchase from GoG.com is yours to enjoy as well :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattered_Steel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattered_Steel&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68b8af986a0161efd75ffedb72727420193db3c","amp;dn":"Good+Old+Games+-+Shattered+Steel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68b8af986a0161efd75ffedb72727420193db3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,139,138,249,134,160,22,30,253,117,255,237,183,39,39,66,1,147,219,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
