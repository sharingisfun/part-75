Lottra is simple to use and easy to view. Large fonts are used on the most used buttons and lists.  But Lottra is not just another random number lottery number picker, it uses a pseudo-random number generator with a seed, and that seed is where you come in.\n\nWhen you get a quick pick from a lottery agent, the lottery computer picks random numbers for your ticket.  It knows nothing about you at all.\n\nLottra is different. It takes your personal input and uses it to create a seed to start the number generator. Currently there are four modes of personal input:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢The Special Date mode: Lets you enter a meaningful or special date for the input.  This date can be any date since January 1, 1900.  The Special Date can be a birthday, anniversary, graduation, or some other date that was lucky for you.\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢The Lottralogy mode: In this mode you can enter your astrological sign or the astrological sign of a loved one.\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢The Chinese Zodiac mode: Here you can select one year of the twelve Chinese Zodiac years. You can choose any year since 1900.\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢The Lucky Number mode: If you have a lucky number like 777 or some other number thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been lucky for you, then you can enter that number in this mode. This number can be up to nine digits long.\n\nHere are a few screen shots of Lottra with the Powerball lottery in Lottralogy mode, followed by the Mega Millions lottery in the Special Date mode, the Hot Lotto in the Chinese Zodiac mode, and the Montana 10 SPOT lottery in Lucky Number mode.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ceae13a511ce5263bd8f551f3c10893f14e2ef7","amp;dn":"BMB+Software+Lottra+v3.5.4.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ceae13a511ce5263bd8f551f3c10893f14e2ef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,234,225,58,81,28,229,38,59,216,245,81,243,193,8,147,241,78,46,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
