Then I read the list more carefully - I tried jackjake's suggestion (although I knew that it would not work as Torrents just don't work that way!) and sure enough it did NOT work!\n\nThen I noticed the last entry by o2ugla, with the registration details so I decided to download the latest file from Ravensheadsservices (http://www.ravensheadservices.com/download.php) and then used the registration details from o2ugla and it WORKED for me!\n\nBetter act fast as the details may get blocked. I have included the Windows download (for W7, W8, XP and Vista) and the registration details supplied by o2ugla - in the txt file.\n\nMy thanks to o2ugla for the original Torrent and to jackjake for giving me the idea.\n\nCheers ... digimike50\n\nSharing is caring ......","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5ce727d85e41646b788b38c7b4fd7da5dc84e60","amp;dn":"WriteItNow407f+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5ce727d85e41646b788b38c7b4fd7da5dc84e60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,206,114,125,133,228,22,70,183,136,179,140,123,79,215,218,93,200,78,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
