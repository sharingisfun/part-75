Things go wrong when his wild younger brother Tony arrives on the scene with his new bride Joan Blake. \n\nUser Review\n\nSaddle the Wind tells the story of Tony Sinclair (John Cassavetes), the troubled younger brother of Steve Sinclair (Robert Taylor) who both share ownership of a cattle ranch. They make for an interesting pair, the caricatured, out of control and insecure kid vs his mature, older, wiser, and better with a gun brother. What's more interesting, but isn't really developed very well, is the emerging situation between Taylor and Julie London, who plays Cassavetes somewhat reluctant fiancÃƒÂ©e that he brings home after a night of carousing. Charles McGraw has an interesting if abbreviated role as the well known gunfighter Larry Venables, who comes into town hunting for Steve (Taylor) but has to deal with Tony (Cassavetes). Purely by luck, Tony kills the far better Venables and now really believes he's a gunfighter. Not only did he kill one of the fastest gunmen around, but he defended his brother as well. He's a kid playing a man's game, and his actions get more out of control, leading to an inevitable showdown with his brother. Putting a juvenile delinquent in a Technicolor western wasn't unknown in the fifties, but Cassavetes is definitely more at home in Brooklyn than Wyoming.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38acf83616a53c48d6df658734f7381a58c8aae","amp;dn":"Saddle+the+Wind+%28Western%29+%7BRobert+Taylor%2C+Julie+London%7D+%5B1958%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b38acf83616a53c48d6df658734f7381a58c8aae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,138,207,131,97,106,83,196,141,109,246,88,115,79,115,129,165,140,138,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
