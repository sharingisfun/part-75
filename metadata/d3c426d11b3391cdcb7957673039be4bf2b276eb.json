The IPA produced can then be submitted to a jailbroken appstore, and later support for .DEB to upload to cydia will be added. For windows, tested on Windows 8.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3c426d11b3391cdcb7957673039be4bf2b276eb","amp;dn":"Gamemaker+Studio+Free+IPA+Builder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3c426d11b3391cdcb7957673039be4bf2b276eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,196,38,209,27,51,145,205,203,121,87,103,48,57,190,75,242,178,118,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
