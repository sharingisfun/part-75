Unsung in WWII fiction is the story of the 6th Army's 6th Infantry Division ('the Sightseein' Sixth') and their jungle commandoes, the Alamo Scouts, under the command of Gen. Walter Kreuger, the trusted and savvy lieutenant of 'America's Caesar,' Douglas MacArthur. Fever Ridge explores unique events, perspectives, exotic locales and peoples that are different than any you have encountered in other WWII storiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and ultimately is the story of a secret that could have changed the War, and the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6377f289aae9845499dc2777df8022d5d4ac1e6","amp;dn":"Fever+Ridge+-+A+Tale+of+MacArthur%27s+Jungle+War+1+%28PDF%29+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6377f289aae9845499dc2777df8022d5d4ac1e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,55,127,40,154,174,152,69,73,157,194,119,125,248,2,45,93,74,193,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
