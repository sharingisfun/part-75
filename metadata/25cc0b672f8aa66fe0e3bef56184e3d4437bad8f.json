JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ controversial words on faith and works show us that genuine faith in Christ always produces works that follow. We also saw that our words and profession of faith are useless without the substance of fruit verifying the our faith is indeed real and genuine.\n\nAthey Creek Christian Fellowship is a body of believers in Wilsonville Oregon desiring to know the Lord in an ever-increasing measure.
