The burly bunch are Michael (John Alderman), David (Tom Basham), Henry (Bob Bihiller), Arnold (Bruce Kimbal), Eddie (Henry Olek) and Ronnie (Maurice Warfield). They're deceptive: although they look like the adventure addicted non-conformists of today out to raise Hell as they brawl their way over countryside and local towns, actually the six are on a different type of trip to the City of the Angels.\n\nWhen they're stopped by two highway patrolman and searched for identification, imagine the shock when instead of the expected drugs, booze and hardware what shows up turns out to be lipstick, dresses, bras, and high heels.
