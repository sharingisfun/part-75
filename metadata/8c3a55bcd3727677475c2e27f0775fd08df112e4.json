My wife Brandy and I are private eyes - and belly-up broke. That's why we agreed to trace Martin Whitlock, a hotshot banker who'd skipped town with over two million dollars in laundered drug money. Not our usual case, but even filthy mob lucre pays bills.\nWhitlock's trail led from a posh mansion to a hick burg called McInerney, Oregon - and to G.O.D. Inc., those geeks who hawk overpriced garbage on late night TV. That's where we found our boy...too often. There were three Marty Whitlocks: same prints. But one was female. One was dead. We got busted. That wasn't the worst.\nThe mob ripoff was only one move in a caper to take over crime - not the Mafia, but something a hell of a lot bigger. Because two-bit McInerney, Oregon, wasn't just off the map...it was off the edge of the Earth.\nAnd Brandy and I were being taken for a ride - into THE LABYRINTH OF DREAMS - Goodreads Summary of The Labyrinth of Dreams (G.O.D. Inc. #1)\n\nNote: A good book recommendable for all sci-fi/fantasy lovers. And the title says G.O.D. (GOD) is because G.O.D. and GOD will yield twice as many results as just one.
