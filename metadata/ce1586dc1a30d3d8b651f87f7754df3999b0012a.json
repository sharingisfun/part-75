In this course, explore options that range from personal desktop databases to large-scale geographically distributed database servers and classic relational databases to modern document-oriented systems and data warehousesÃ¢â‚¬â€and learn how to choose the best solution for you. Author Simon Allardice covers key terminology and concepts, such as normalization, &quot;deadly embraces&quot; and &quot;dirty reads,&quot; ACID and CRUD, referential integrity, deadlocks, and rollbacks. The course also explores data modeling step by step through hands-on examples to design the best system for our data. Plus, learn to juggle the competing demands of storage, access, performance, and securityÃ¢â‚¬â€management tasks that are critical to your database's success. \n \nTopics include: \n\n- What is a database?\n- Why do you need a database?\n- Choosing primary keys\n- Identifying columns and selecting data types\n- Defining relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many\n- Understanding normalization\n- Creating queries to create, insert, update, and delete data\n- Understanding indexing and stored procedures\n- Exploring your database options\n\n\n*** THERE ARE NO EXERCISE FILES AVAILABLE IN THIS LESSON ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce1586dc1a30d3d8b651f87f7754df3999b0012a","amp;dn":"+-+Foundations+of+Programming+Databases","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce1586dc1a30d3d8b651f87f7754df3999b0012a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,21,134,220,26,48,211,216,182,81,248,127,119,84,223,57,153,176,1,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
