To outsiders, Thomas Montgomery seemed like the perfect family \nman taking his girls to swim lessons and his dog Shadow for walks each day. He had a \nbeautiful wife by the name of Cindy for 16 years.\n\nInspired by the chilling real-life cast of Thomas Montgomery, this made-for-television \ndrama from producer/director Courteney Cox serves as a cautionary tale about trusting \nstrangers on the internet. Montgomery was a family man fast-approaching 50 when he began\nchatting with an online stranger who claimed to be a gorgeous teenage girl. Infatuated \nwith the pictures she had sent to him, he claimed to be an 18-year-old Marine recruit who\nwas on his way to boot camp. Before long, Montgomery and his internet chat partner were\nengaging in intense rounds of cyber sex. But when the mysterious internet beauty turned \nher affections toward one of Tommy's co-workers, the stage is set for a deadly confrontation\nfueled by deception and desire.\n\n\nFile Name: Talhotblond.avi\nFile Size (Bytes): 734,930,084\n\n[Format]\nFormat (Short Name): avi\nFormat (Long Name): AVI format\nDuration: 01:28:55.99\nDuration (Microseconds): 5,335,993,069\nBit Rate (bits/sec): 1,101,845\nNumber of Streams: 2\n\n[Stream #0]\nType: Video\nCodec (Short Name): mpeg4\nCodec (Long Name): MPEG-4 part 2\nCodec Tag: 0x44495658\nCodec Tag (String): XVID\nCodec Time Base: 1001/24000\nTime Base: 417083/10000000\nReal Base Frame Rate: 24000/1001\nAverage Frame Rate: 0/0\nDuration: 00:00:00.99\nDuration (Microseconds): 127,936\nBit Rate (bits/sec): N/A\nNumber of Frames: 127,936\n\nWidth: 640\nHeight: 352\nPixel Aspect Ratio: 1:1\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 20:11\nPixel Format: yuv420p\nHas B Frames: Yes\n\n[Stream #1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e627481c85d9847bbc8dbf909840b4746229653","amp;dn":"Talhotblond+%28DVDRip+XviD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e627481c85d9847bbc8dbf909840b4746229653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,98,116,129,200,93,152,71,187,200,219,249,9,132,11,71,70,34,150,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
