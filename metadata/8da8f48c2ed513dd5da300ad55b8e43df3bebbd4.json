Since that album, Bad for Good, Meat Loaf has recorded almost every track from it. This album is what I think Meat Loaf's Bad for Good could have been. I've included two tracks from Meat Loaf's second album, Dead Ringer, to fill in the gaps left by Dance In My Pants, and Stark Raving Love as they were never recorded by Meat Loaf. I've also spliced in Jim's spoken word intro into Left in the Dark by Meat. Hope you enjoy.\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. Bad for Good\n2. Lost Boys and Golden Girls\n3. Love and Death and the American Guitar\n4. Dead Ringer for Love\n5. Out of the Frying Pan (and into the Fire)\n6. Surf's Up\n7. Peel Out\n8. Left in the Dark\n9. The Storm\n10.
