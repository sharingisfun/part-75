Marks\n\nTift Merritt seems torn between wanderlust and homesickness on Traveling Alone, which Ã¢â‚¬â€œ partly thanks to the assistance of guitarists Marc Ribot and Eric Heywood, and Calexico drummer John Convertino Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sounds like her best album yet.\n\nTracks like &quot;Still Not Home&quot; and &quot;Traveling Alone&quot; find her itchily hankering to move on, keen to confront her destiny. But there's an obvious yearning for the security of stability in &quot;Sweet Spot&quot; and &quot;Feeling of Beauty&quot;. There's a tough edge to her country-rock style, with hard, sleek guitars animating the horticultural erotica of &quot;Spring&quot; ; but her vocals are most impressively showcased &quot;Drifted Apart&quot;, a fatalistic break-up duet with Andrew Bird about &quot;growing into what you are&quot;, even if that takes you away from someone.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74f03704efe3d922dc59e70c8f3a0f44eaf3425e","amp;dn":"Tift+Merritt+-+Traveling+Alone+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74f03704efe3d922dc59e70c8f3a0f44eaf3425e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,240,55,4,239,227,217,34,220,89,231,12,143,58,15,68,234,243,66,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
