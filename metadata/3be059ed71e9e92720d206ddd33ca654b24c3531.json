Each episode (156 in the original series) is a mixture of self-contained drama, psychological thriller, fantasy, science fiction, suspense, or horror, often concluding with a macabre or unexpected twist. A popular and critical success, it introduced many Americans to serious science fiction and abstract ideas through television and also through a wide variety of Twilight Zone literature.\n\nThe program followed in the tradition of earlier shows like Tales of Tomorrow (1951Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1953)Ã¢â‚¬â€which also dramatized the short story &quot;What You Need&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€and Science Fiction Theatre (1955Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1957), as well as radio programs such as The Weird Circle, X Minus One, and the radio work of Serling's hero, dramatist Norman Corwin.\n\nThe success of the series led to a feature film, a radio series, a comic book, a magazine, and various other spin-offs that spanned five decades, including two &quot;revival&quot; television series. The first ran on CBS and in syndication in the 1980s, the second ran on UPN from 2002 to 2003","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3be059ed71e9e92720d206ddd33ca654b24c3531","amp;dn":"THE+TWILIGHT+ZONE+%5BCOMPLETE%5D%5BVERIFIED-VIDZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3be059ed71e9e92720d206ddd33ca654b24c3531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,224,89,237,113,233,233,39,32,210,6,221,211,60,166,84,178,76,53,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
