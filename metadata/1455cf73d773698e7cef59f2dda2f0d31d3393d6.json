On April 28th I came to Him and said, &quot;Lord, I feel so bad, I know that I'm a sinner,&quot; and I told Him how I felt.  &quot;Lord, forgive me.  I want You to write my name in the Book of Life and to accept me as Your child.&quot;  I repented and gave back my life to the Lord.  I said, &quot;Lord, I want You to change me, to make a difference in me.&quot; I cried with all my heart, asking the Lord to change me.  But, as time passed by I felt no change.  The only difference was that I began to attend church, to read the Bible and to pray.  That was the only change in my life. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://spiritlessons.com/languages/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://spiritlessons.com/languages/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gospelgo.com/q/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gospelgo.com/q/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1455cf73d773698e7cef59f2dda2f0d31d3393d6","amp;dn":"Divine+Revelations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1455cf73d773698e7cef59f2dda2f0d31d3393d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,85,207,115,215,115,105,142,124,239,89,242,221,162,240,211,29,51,147,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
