Unzip, copy app_APOLLO.img and amlboot into the root of USB Thumb Drive. Insert it into the V3 USB Port. (Please don't put those 2 files into any folder)\n\n2. Connect NBOX V3 with TV through AV cable (Red/Yellow/White). The system reset to the original configuration, so the use of other input results in no image after reboot, which can cause confusion.\n\n3. Go to Setup (the 7th option on the right side), then select Upgrade. The upgrade will start automatically and complete in 1-2 minutes.\n\n\nerrors during the procedure, such as lack of energy, can seriously compromise your NBOX, I do not take responsibility for any damage caused, do it by your on risk.\n\nChanges:\nI never found an official list of changes, but by my experience:\n-better support to many codecs, expecialy MKV\n-special characters (ÃƒÂ¡,ÃƒÂ©,ÃƒÂ­.. etc)\n\n\n\nHave fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f15dff6dc5c806cf8a4766dc74f2c6389094d15d","amp;dn":"Nbox+v3+%28N82%29+firmware+-+NBox+Media+Player+Model+N82","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f15dff6dc5c806cf8a4766dc74f2c6389094d15d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,93,255,109,197,200,6,207,138,71,102,220,116,242,198,56,144,148,209,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
