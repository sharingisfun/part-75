Diseases of the South is a one-man operation that primarily works with loops, vocal layering, and electronic production equipment to build songs. Both music and found sound bring inspiration. DOTS' aesthetic sensibilities descend from the loop layering of Andrew Bird and Tune-Yards, the sonic expansion of electronic artists Stimming, the Field, and Deadmau5, and textured jams of bands like Radiohead and TV on the Radio.
