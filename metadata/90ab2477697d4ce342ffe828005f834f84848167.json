American kids, targeted from birth with sales pitches for everything from Hollywood merchandise and junk food to iPods, cell phones, and the family car, now influence an estimated $700 billion in annual consumer spending. Consuming Kids traces the evolution and impact of this unprecedented phenomenon. Drawing on the insights of children's health experts, media critics, and industry insiders, it blows the lid off the youth marketing industry's stealth tactics and explores the effects of consumerism on the imaginative lives of children.\n\n\nVENDOLLA\nVARNA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90ab2477697d4ce342ffe828005f834f84848167","amp;dn":"Consuming.Kids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90ab2477697d4ce342ffe828005f834f84848167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,171,36,119,105,125,76,227,66,255,232,40,0,95,131,79,132,132,129,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
