Steve McQueen\nplays the pugnacious Charriere (known as &quot;Papillon,&quot; or &quot;butterfly,\n&quot; because of a prominent tatoo), incarcerated--wrongly, he claims--\nfor murdering a pimp. He saves the life of fellow convict Louis Dega\n(Dustin Hoffman), a counterfeiter who will later show his gratitude\nby helping Charriere in his many escape attempts, and by smuggling \nfood to Charriere when the latter is put in solitary confinement. \nOne breakout, which takes Charriere and Dega to a leper colony and \nthen to a native encampment, is almost successful, but Charriere is \nbetrayed (allegedly because he stopped for an act of kindness) and \nback the prisoners go to French Guiana. Years later, Dega is made a \ntrustee and is content with his lot, but the ageing, white-haired \nCharriere cannot be held back.
