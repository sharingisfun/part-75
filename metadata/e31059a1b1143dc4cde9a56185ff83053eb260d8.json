Its leaves were shuffled and then rebound into two volumes to make each look more or less complete. The first part was acquired by the duke of Arenberg, whose descendants owned it until 1957, when it was bought by New York dealer H. P. Kraus, who sold it to Alistair Bradley Martin. This volume had been known by scholars as the &quot;Hours of Catherine of Cleves.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, the second part had been acquired by the Rothschild family, who kept their manuscripts secret. In 1963 their volume was sold to the Morgan as yet another &quot;Hours of Catherine of Cleves.&quot; Studying the newly acquired book (it became MS M.917) along with the Martin volume, Morgan curator John Plummer determined that they were actually two halves of one and the same codex. In 1964 the Morgan mounted an exhibition of both volumes, displaying all the miniatures via color transparencies. When a facsimile of the manuscript was published by George Braziller in 1966, the exhibition was repeated. Finally, in 1970, the Morgan was able to buy the Martin volume (it became MS M.945), and thus came to own both parts of this greatest of all Dutch manuscripts.\n\nBoth volumes have been disbound in preparation for rebinding the leaves in proper order.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hours_of_Catherine_of_Cleves&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hours_of_Catherine_of_Cleves&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e31059a1b1143dc4cde9a56185ff83053eb260d8","amp;dn":"The+Hours+of+Catherine+of+Cleves+-+Illuminated+Manuscript","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e31059a1b1143dc4cde9a56185ff83053eb260d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,16,89,161,177,20,61,196,205,233,165,97,133,255,131,5,62,178,96,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
