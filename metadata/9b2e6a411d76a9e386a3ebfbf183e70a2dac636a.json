It contains 79 chapters that relate to animal and bacterial virology. The first section includes 34 chapters that describe general features of farm and other animals of agricultural importance.\nSection 2 contains 20 chapters describing other animal viruses, and Section 3 has four chapters on avian viruses.\nIn section 4, the 10 chapters are devoted to viruses affecting aquatic species such as fish and crustaceans. The volume concludes with Section 5, which contains 11 chapters, and deals with viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages).\n\n\nTitle: Desk Encyclopedia of Animal and Bacterial Virology\nAuthor: Mahy B., Regenmortel M.\nPublisher: Academic Press\nYear: 2010\nISBN: 978-0-12-375144-7\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nDesk Encyclopedia of General Virology\n=====================================\n\nThis volume, derived from 'Encyclopedia of Virology', provides an overview of the development of virology during the last ten years. Entries detail the nature, origin, phylogeny and evolution of viruses. It then moves into a summary of our understanding of the structure and assembly of virus particles and describes how this knowledge was obtained. Genetic material of viruses and the different mechanisms used by viruses to infect and replicate in their host cells are highlighted. The volume is rounded out with an overview of some major groups of viruses with particular attention being given to our current knowledge of their molecular biology. This is the most comprehensive single-volume source providing an overview of virology to non-specialists. It bridges the gap between basic undergraduate texts and specialized reviews. It offers concise and general overviews of important topics within the field that will help when preparing for lectures, writing reports, or drafting grant applications.\n\n\nTitle: Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology\nAuthor: Mahy B., Regenmortel M.\nPublisher: Academic Press\nYear: 2010\nISBN: 978-0-12-375146-1\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n\nDesk Encyclopedia of Plant and Fungal Virology\n==============================================\n\n\nIt consists of 85 chapters that highlight recent advances in our knowledge of the viruses that infect plants and fungi. The first section of the book, comprising 10 chapters, discusses general topics in plant virology such as the movement of viruses in plants, the transmission of plant viruses by vectors, antiviral defense mechanisms in plants, and the development of virus-resistant transgenic plants. A chapter is devoted to viroids.\n\nTitle: Desk Encyclopedia of Plant and Fungal Virology\nAuthor: Mahy B., Regenmortel M.\nPublisher: Academic Press\nYear: 2010\nISBN: 978-0-12-375148-5\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nMore info on the books below:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0123751446/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0123751446/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0123751462/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0123751462/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0123751489/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0123751489/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
