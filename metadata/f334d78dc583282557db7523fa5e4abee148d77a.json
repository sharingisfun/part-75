In many ways, Moontan is like a summation of everything the group had learned on their first three albums. It presents a similar combination of prog epics, heavy rockers, and songs that combine both elements, but everything is raised to a new level of inspiration and polish. It starts with a bang thanks to &quot;Candy's Going Bad,&quot; a piece that starts off as a thunderous, pounding rocker but transforms midway into a bluesy instrumental mood piece. Other highlights include the hit single &quot;Radar Love,&quot; a relentless rock tune with a left-field instrumental break in which tribal drums duel with a big band-style horn section, and &quot;Just Like Vince Taylor,&quot; a guitar-slinging slice of boogie rock that pays tribute to the fallen rock idol of the title. The album also includes what may be the group's finest prog effort in &quot;Vanilla Queen&quot;: this classic builds from pulsating, ominous verses dominated by synthesizer into a hard-rocking chorus and also throws in a stark acoustic guitar midsection before climaxing in a frantic band jam augmented by blaring horns and an ever-spiraling string section. Despite the album's overall strength, not every song reaches these heights: &quot;Are You Receiving Me?&quot; recycles some hooks from the group's past classic &quot;She Flies on Strange Wings,&quot; and the twangy country-pop of &quot;Suzy Lunacy (Mental Rock)&quot; is a little too poppy to gel with the rest of the album. However, even these tunes benefit from tight arrangements and a spirited, totally committed performance from the group. The result is an album that retains its power today. In the end, Moontan is a necessity for Golden Earring fans, and a worthwhile listen for anyone interested in 1970s rock at its most adventurous.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f334d78dc583282557db7523fa5e4abee148d77a","amp;dn":"Golden+Earring+-+Moontan+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f334d78dc583282557db7523fa5e4abee148d77a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,52,215,141,197,131,40,37,87,219,117,35,250,94,74,190,225,72,215,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
