BeyoncÃƒÂ©'s cousin Kelendria &quot;Kelly&quot; Rowland joined the group in 1992, and shortly thereafter they landed an appearance on Star Search, where they performed a rap song. The quartet's lineup was finalized (for the time being) when LeToya Luckett joined in 1993, and they spent the next few years working their way up from the Houston club scene, eventually opening for artists like SWV, Dru Hill, and Immature. Finally, in 1997, Destiny's Child were offered a recording contract by Columbia. \n\nWhile it was issued just prior to the group's reunion performance during the halftime show of Super Bowl XLVII and, oh yeah, Valentine's Day 2013, Love Songs is more thoughtful than expected. &quot;Cater 2 U&quot; is the lone inclusion that was released as a single, unless you count Timbaland's slinky mix of &quot;Say My Name.&quot; Otherwise, this is a sharp selection of deep album cuts, including one from Kelly Rowland's Simply Deep (&quot;Heaven&quot;), that demonstrates the group's depth behind the hits. The one new song, &quot;Nuclear,&quot; is a knockout. Produced by Pharrell, it sounds more like something released in 1990 by the Chimes, Soul II Soul, or the Family Stand than any pop-R&amp;B circa 2013. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.93% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia /Legacy\nCatalog:\t\t88765430182\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Cater 2 U (2004 - Destiny Fulfilled)\n02.Killing Time (1998 - Destiny's Child)\n03.Second Nature (1998 - Destiny's Child)\n04.Heaven (2002 - Simply Deep)\n05.Now That She's Gone (1999 - The Writing's On The Wall)\n06.Brown Eyes (2001 - Survivor)\n07.If (2004 - Destiny Fulfilled)\n08.Emotion (2001 - Survivor)\n09.If You Leave (Feat.
