Although the band are playing a typical live set from this point in their career, the film is notable for having no audience.\nThe main footage in and around the amphitheatre was filmed over four days in October 1971, using the band's regular touring equipment, including studio-quality 24-track recorders. Additional footage filmed in a Paris television studio that December made up the original 1972 release. The film was then re-released in 1974 with additional studio material of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon, and interviews at Abbey Road Studios.\nThe film has subsequently been released on video numerous times, and in 2003 a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; DVD appeared which combines the original footage from 1971 with more contemporary shots of space and the area around Pompeii, assembled by Maben. A number of notable bands have taken inspiration from the film in creating their own videos, or filming concerts without an audience.\n\n2003 director's cut\n&quot;Echoes, Part 1&quot;/&quot;On the Run&quot; (studio footage) (uncredited) (from Meddle/The Dark Side of the Moon, 1971/1973)\n&quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot; (from Ummagumma, 1969)\n&quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; (from A Saucerful of Secrets, 1968)\n&quot;Us and Them&quot; (studio footage) (from The Dark Side of the Moon, 1973)\n&quot;One of These Days I'm Going to Cut You into Little Pieces&quot; (from Meddle, 1971)\n&quot;Mademoiselle Nobs&quot; (from Meddle, 1971)\n&quot;Brain Damage&quot; (studio footage) (from The Dark Side of the Moon, 1973)\n&quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; (from A Saucerful of Secrets, 1968)\n&quot;Echoes, Part 2&quot; (from Meddle, 1971)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ad750f95feb33bf1d8f78d0cdaf297cf6041287","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+Live+in+Pompeii","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ad750f95feb33bf1d8f78d0cdaf297cf6041287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,215,80,249,95,235,51,191,29,143,120,208,205,175,41,124,246,4,18,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
