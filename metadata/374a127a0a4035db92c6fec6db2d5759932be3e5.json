It runs in the system tray and allows user to control the native firewall easily without having to waste time by navigating to the specific part of the firewall. This is the best tool to manage the native firewall from Windows 8, Windows 7 and Windows Vista.\n\nWindows Firewall Control offers four filtering modes which can be switched with just a mouse click:\nNo Filtering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Windows Firewall is turned off. Avoid using this setting unless you have another firewall running on your computer.\nHigh Filtering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ All outgoing connections are blocked. This setting blocks all attempts to connect to and from your computer.\nMedium Filtering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Outgoing connections that do not match a rule are blocked. Only programs you allow can initiate outgoing connections.\nLow Filtering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Outgoing connections that do not match a rule are allowed. You can block the programs you do not want to initiate outgoing connections.\n\nProgram Features:\n=================\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Just one small executable file. All features are packed in the same file.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full support for executing tasks from standard user accounts.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Intuitive and easy accessible interface in the system tray.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Allow or block a program to connect to the internet with just one mouse click.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Shell integration into the right click context menu of the executable files.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Search for invalid rules with the possibility to delete them.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Quick access to edit Windows Firewall rules directly from the program interface.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Choose if you want the program to start at user logon.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Import and export the policy of the program.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Protection to unauthorized uninstallation.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Possibility to restore previous settings at uninstallation.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Check for a new version from the program interface.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ And many moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Just give it a try.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Learning Mode which provides notifications for blocked outgoing connections.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Search for executable files in a user defined folder and create new rules for the selected ones from the result list.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n=====================\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.0\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Compatible with all 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows 8, Windows 7 and Windows Vista.\n\nChanges in 3.8.1.1:\n====================\nNew: Added support to new strings to be translated, especially for the Activation process.\nFixed: The language file is not loaded if the program is started from the shortcut because the startup folder is not the same as the program folder.
