Emphasizing class struggles that have proliferated across the social body of global capitalism, Caffentzis shows how these struggles are so central to the dynamic of the system that even the most sophisticated machines cannot liberate capitalism from class struggle and the need for labor. The writings draw upon a careful rereading of MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thought in order to elucidate political concerns of the day and document the peculiar way in which capital perpetuates violence and proliferates misery on a world scale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b805feaf0c738f327273970e773970aac4d4a84","amp;dn":"In+Letters+of+Blood+and+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b805feaf0c738f327273970e773970aac4d4a84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,128,95,234,240,199,56,243,39,39,57,112,231,115,151,10,172,77,74,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
