The album takes influences from dubstep, house and drum and bass and raises it to a level never seen before. At a quick glance, International View sees a more refined take on his previous album's hit Pixie Dust, his Battle for Athens remixes hit harder than ever, and he wraps up the album with his micro house tribute to Barbara Palvin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adcaab35d128cd92669e6bf9750654598f0065b7","amp;dn":"%23raccune+-+International+View+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adcaab35d128cd92669e6bf9750654598f0065b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,202,171,53,209,40,205,146,102,158,107,249,117,6,84,89,143,0,101,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
