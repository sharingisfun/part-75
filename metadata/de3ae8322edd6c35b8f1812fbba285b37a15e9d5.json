These films are of a much higher Quality than The History Channels portrayal of The Bible.\n\nDescription:\n\nThis is one of the Best Bible Movies I have seen. Ben is outstanding.\n\nDescription:\n\n\nAcademy Award-winner Ben Kingsley (Gandhi) is MOSES in this awe-inspiring tale of an ordinary man called upon by God to become a great leader.\n\nMoses is awe-struck when God, in the form of a burning bush, calls him to guide the Israelites out of bondage. The reluctant leader and his flock begin the treacherous journey to the Promised Land. However, Pharaoh intends to stop the exodus and with his brutal army traps the Israelites by the banks of the Red Sea. Yet these Israelites are God's chosen people, and the waters part, allowing their safe passage. Moses continues the chronicle of the pilgrimage to Canaan, through the life of this amazing leader and the many miracles God bestowed. MOSES is the fourth in a collectible series of Turner Original films based on Old Testament stories.\n\nAlso:\nThe Five Books of Moses.\nMoses Red Sea\nMoses Ten Commandments\nMuhammad and The Law Moses The Torah and Jesus the Christ\nTestament - Moses\nThe Bible Collection - Vol 03 - Moses - 1\nThe Bible Collection - Vol 03 - Moses - 2\nTom Horn -- Prophecies &amp; Rumors of Prophecies on Trunews\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.
