He graduated from University of Malaya and worked as an electrical engineer with the Public Works of Department for twelve years before going forth into the homeless life. His interest in religion led him to study the world's major religions for a few years before meeting the Buddha's teachings in 1976.\n\nIn 1983, he went forth into the homeless life in the Mahayana tradition. He was re-ordained in the Theravada tradition in Thailand three years later. After that he spent about ten years living the solitary lifestyle in quiet places. He has written numerous booklets and articles on Buddhism, e.g. &quot;Return to the Original Buddha Teachings&quot;, &quot;Message of the Buddha&quot;, &quot;Buddhist Monk's Precepts&quot;, etc.\n\nin 1998, through donations from his supporters, he founded a 15 acre forest monastery, Vihada Buddha Gotama, just outside the town of Temoh, near Kampar, in the state of Perak. The monastery is mainly for the study of the Suttas (discourses) and Vinaya (monastic discipline), and the practice of meditation, according to the original teachings of the Buddha. It is open to monks and nuns (marchees or anagarinis), and also laymen and laywomen.\n\nIn 1999, a Sangha Foundation was registered with the following objectives:\n(a) To foster the teaching, practice and understanding of the Buddha-dhamma - i.e. the teaching of the Buddha, with special emphasis on the Theravada tradition - for the Buddhist Community.\n(b) To participate in social and welfare activities for the benefit of mankind.\n(c) To do all such acts and things as are in the opinion of the Foundation necessary for the attainment of the aforesaid objectives.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vbgnet.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vbgnet.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68e4d79408cbd740324c492908c2b5da286074f9","amp;dn":"Buddhist+Nikaya+Sutta+Dhamma+lectures+by+Dhammavuddho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68e4d79408cbd740324c492908c2b5da286074f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,228,215,148,8,203,215,64,50,76,73,41,8,194,181,218,40,96,116,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
