He was a fan of TV wrestling as a child, but can't get out of a headlock. He finds a local wrestling trainer and through a series of events eventually starts to train. He is slowly transformed as he begins his second job as the cheating villain wrestler known as the Foul King. He starts to stand up for himself in odd ways that are not really in his own best interest. Events get out of hand as conflicting influences come together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:207f4c94f5b92c3b2fc33f4d2be57da624f7f1c7","amp;dn":"Foul+King+2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"207f4c94f5b92c3b2fc33f4d2be57da624f7f1c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,127,76,148,245,185,44,59,47,195,63,77,43,229,125,166,36,247,241,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
