But I am quite certain that the genius in Frank would feel honored. No words can describe his greatness (and importance). This Master of so many giants plays a difficult role in our Rock or better, music history. Mainly because not many people could understand what he was doing (himself included sometimes). People just want to enjoy (consume) music like it is candy. Franks music simply does not allow that.\n\nI myself rather avoided his brutal musical expressions and playing it for others was asking for trouble. Same can be said about his film. However, Frank cannot be avoided and making his music (and ideas) more accessible I was forced to listen a bit more. Now, 35 years later I finally have some idea.\n\nFrank was more a performer and musician then a singer (good though). So I included some life recordings (I hardly ever do) in which his talents really excelled. Judge for yourself and try to enjoy (and share, Frank would like that) \n\n\nDutch Treat - @45 Dancin' Fool (Frank Zappa)\n\n01 Sy Borg\n02 Joe's Garage\n03 Cosmik Debris\n04 Titties &amp; Beer (L)\n05 The Torture Never Stops\n06 Be In My Video\n07 Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up\n08 On The Bus\n09 Dancin' Fool\n10 Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\n11 Fine Girl\n12 Cheap Thrills\n13 Montana\n14 Dinah-Moe-Hum\n15 Dirty Love\n16 Let's Make The Water Turn Black\n17 Disco Boy\n18 How Could I Be Such A Fool\n19 Little Umbrellas\n20 Society Pages\n21 We Are Not Alone\n22 Catholic Girls\n23 Fembot In A Wet T-Shirt\n24 Baby, Take Your Teeth Out\n25 Stick It Out\n26 Bobby Brown Goes Down (L)\n27 Sexual Harassment In The Workplace (L)\n28 Bolero (L)\n29 Sofa No. 1 (L)\n30 Pink Napkins (L)\n31 Yo' Mama (L)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34b8289e387c03f8d54beda6489c953200a1137a","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Dancin%60+Fool+%28Dutch+Treat+%4045+VBR+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34b8289e387c03f8d54beda6489c953200a1137a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,184,40,158,56,124,3,248,213,75,237,166,72,156,149,50,0,161,19,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
