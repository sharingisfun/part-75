It is in 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen) and is in 720p High Definition. It had some encoding and resampling issues from low bitrate and film grain which ended up permanently making the video slightly blurry during movement, so the quality isn't perfect. It has English, Greek, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Traditional and Simplified Chinese subtitles.\n\nA lot of the music was changed to refresh the game and to emphasize certain key moments, like that of a film.\n\n---Credits---\n\nAll the credit goes to Team Silent and Konami for publishing this game. I would also like to thank specifically Hiroyuki Owaku for the incredible storyline, Masahiro Ito  for the disturbing creatures and design, Takayoshi Sato for the lifelike characters, Akira Yamaoka for bringing the games to life with his memorable music, and the rest of the staff for making it all happen.\n\nGame Captures, Audio / Video Editing, and Visual Direction\nFUNGO\n\nAll the music provided by artists in the Silent Hill community, but mainly\nBROKEN NOTES\n\n---SONG CREDITS---\n\n[PART I]\n&quot;Crimson Paintings&quot; by Christophe Frutuoso\nBroken Notes Sanatorium (2010)\n\n&quot;Ancient Ruins in the Forest&quot; by John Anthony Mathewson\nBroken Notes Sanatorium (2010)\n\n&quot;The Fog (Part II)&quot; by Christophe Frutuoso\nBroken Notes Sanatorium (2010)\n\n&quot;Fear For the Flesh&quot; by John Anthony Mathewson\nBroken Notes (2003)\n\n&quot;Dark Waters of Toluca Lake&quot; by John Anthony Mathewson\nBroken Notes (2003)\n\n&quot;Apartment&quot; by Jason Gervais\nBroken Notes: Silent Hill Fan Soundtrack (2002)\n\n&quot;Stalker&quot; by Samantha Dean\nUnpublished song for Broken Notes &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blackannis.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blackannis.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Fallen Perception&quot; by Christopher So\nBroken Notes Melancholy (2005)\n\n&quot;Tales of Ancient Times&quot; by Christophe Frutuoso\nBroken Notes Sanatorium (2010)\n\n&quot;Upon Arrival&quot; by Samantha Dean\nBroken Notes: Silent Hill Fan Soundtrack (2002)\n\n&quot;Remembering Laura&quot; by Ray Richmond\n\n&quot;I'm Here&quot; by Jason Gervais\nBroken Notes: Silent Hill Fan Soundtrack (2002)\n\n&quot;Ashes of Bitterness&quot; by Christophe Frutuoso\nBroken Notes Sanatorium (2010)\n\n&quot;Criterion&quot; by Jason Gervais &amp; Samantha Dean\nBroken Notes: Silent Hill Fan Soundtrack (2002)\n\nAll other songs, namely the ambience, were from Silent Hill 2, including &quot;Heaven's Night&quot; by Akira Yamaoka.\n\n[PART II]\n&quot;Lakeview Hotel&quot; by Jason Gervais\nBroken Notes: Silent Hill Fan Soundtrack (2002)\n\n&quot;Midwich Elementary&quot; by Jason Gervais\nBroken Notes: Silent Hill Fan Soundtrack (2002)\n\n&quot;Remembering Laura&quot; by Ray Richmond\n\n&quot;Gray Afternoon&quot; by Christopher So\nBroken Notes Sanatorium (2010)\n\n&quot;Noir Ambience (Movement One)&quot; by Jason Gervais\nBroken Notes Melancholy (2005)\n\n&quot;Grinder&quot; by Samantha Dean\nBroken Notes (2003)\n\n&quot;In the Midnight Streets&quot; by Jason Gervais\nBroken Notes Melancholy (2005)\n\n&quot;Sleeping In Her Dream&quot; by Christophe Frutuoso\nBroken Notes Sanatorium (2010)\n\n&quot;Silent Corridors (Part II)&quot; by Jason Gervais\nBroken Notes Sanatorium (2010)\n\n&quot;Labyrinth&quot; by Jason Gervais and Samantha Dean\nBroken Notes: Silent Hill Fan Soundtrack (2002)\n\n&quot;Ake ni Somaru&quot; by Takanashi Yasuharu\nJigoku-Shoujo (Hell Girl) Original Soundtrack\n2006 Ã‚Â© Sony Music Entertainment\n\n&quot;Anguish of Brookhaven&quot; by John Anthony Mathewson\nBroken Notes Melancholy (2005)\n\n&quot;Eddie Snaps&quot; by Jason Gervais and Samantha Dean\nBroken Notes: Silent Hill Fan Soundtrack (2002)\n\nAll other songs, namely the ambience, were from Silent Hill 2, including &quot;Magdalene&quot; by Akira Yamaoka.\n\n[PART III]\n&quot;Alone&quot; by Spike Masters\n\n&quot;I Won't Lose You Again&quot; by Sefiros\n\n&quot;Remembering Laura&quot; by Ray Richmond\n\n&quot;Silent Hill 2 Music box (Vocal)&quot; by Kate the Great 19\n\n&quot;The Truth About Laura&quot; by Lionheart\n\n&quot;The Powers of Darkness (Movement Four)&quot; by Jason Gervais\nBroken Notes Melancholy (2005)\n\n&quot;Walk Away&quot; by Samantha Dean\nBroken Notes Melancholy (2005)\n\n&quot;The Mist&quot; by Derrick Koo\nBroken Notes Melancholy (2005)\n\n&quot;Difficult Acceptance&quot; by Christopher So\nBroken Notes Melancholy (2005)\n\n&quot;Kill Me James&quot; by Samantha Dean\nBroken Notes: Silent Hill Fan Soundtrack (2002)\n\n&quot;Silent Hill 2: New Promises R:TS Mix&quot; by Pot Hocket\n\n&quot;Promise&quot; by DJ Skullhead","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eef21701a26e0e930ae0b0c92b8b6a58059067e","amp;dn":"Silent+Hill+2%3A+The+Movie+720P+HD+-+Video+Game+Edit+by+Fungo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eef21701a26e0e930ae0b0c92b8b6a58059067e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,239,33,112,26,38,224,233,48,174,11,12,146,184,182,165,128,89,6,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
