Cash walked into the soon-to-be-famous Sun Studios in Memphis. It was a moment that would have an indelible effect on American culture. With his driving freight-train chords, steel-eyed intensity and a voice as deep and black as night, Cash sang blistering songs of heartache and survival that were gutsy, full of real life and unlike anything heard before. That day kicked off the electrifying early career of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix). As he pioneered a fiercely original sound that blazed a trail for rock, country, punk, folk and rap stars to come, Cash began a rough-and-tumble journey of personal transformation. In the most volatile period of his life, he evolved from a self-destructive pop star into the iconic &quot;Man in Black&quot; -- facing down his demons, fighting for the love that would raise him up, and learning how to walk the razor-thin line between destruction and redemption. As his music changed the world, CashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own world was rocked by the woman who became the love of his life: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).\n\n\nseed and enjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3185e154966b4a0a3c32a2f450e3b0c1be3b2b2c","amp;dn":"Walk+the+Line+%282005%29+720P+Itunes+5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3185e154966b4a0a3c32a2f450e3b0c1be3b2b2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,133,225,84,150,107,74,10,60,50,162,244,80,227,176,193,190,59,43,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
