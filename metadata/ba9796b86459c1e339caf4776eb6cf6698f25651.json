They slayed hundreds in the name of the Lord. Study these mighty men that made up the Lord's army, and glean lessons for the battles you are facing in your own life.\n\nIn this sermon, Walter Veith dissects 1 Chronicles 11, plumbing the depths of the typology in these verses. Be reminded that Christ will conquer the oppositionÃ¢â‚¬â€including the sin that lives in each of us.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Door Was Shut  For Every Truth - Philip Sizemore:\nThe parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25 gives us a picture of what will happen just prior to Christ's Second Coming -- some people will try to get into heaven, but the door of probation will shut because they did not obey the truth they professed to believe. Join Pastor Philip Sizemore as he analyzes the symbolism of this parable and its urgent message to all people today.

Snyder, in the book, In Pursuit of God: The Life Of A.W. Tozer. &quot;He had the ability to make his listeners face themselves in the light of what God was saying to them,&quot; writes Snyder.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n                                           \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba9796b86459c1e339caf4776eb6cf6698f25651","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Victory+Over+Sin+and+Evil+Vol+15+-+Army+Of+the+Lord","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba9796b86459c1e339caf4776eb6cf6698f25651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,151,150,184,100,89,193,227,57,202,244,119,110,182,207,102,152,242,86,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
