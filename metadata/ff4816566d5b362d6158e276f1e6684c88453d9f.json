Paula Crisostomo (now Romo) is not Mexican- American--she is Filipina-American. She and her husband, then boyfriend were roommates of mine in college. We are very good friends and I see her often.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff4816566d5b362d6158e276f1e6684c88453d9f","amp;dn":"Walkout%5B2006%5DDvDRip%5BEng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff4816566d5b362d6158e276f1e6684c88453d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,72,22,86,109,91,54,45,97,88,226,118,241,230,104,76,136,69,61,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
