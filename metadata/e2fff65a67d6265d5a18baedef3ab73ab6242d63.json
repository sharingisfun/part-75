Free from unrealistic media representations of perfect bodies and pornstar practices, Loving Sex shows you the positions that work, helps resolve common problems without blame or embarrassment, and explains just how important sex can be to long-term loving happiness.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2fff65a67d6265d5a18baedef3ab73ab6242d63","amp;dn":"Loving+Sex+-The+Book+of+Joy+and+Passion+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2fff65a67d6265d5a18baedef3ab73ab6242d63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,255,246,90,103,214,38,93,90,24,186,237,239,58,183,58,182,36,45,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
