It was created by filmmaker and horror/fantasy novelist Clive Barker, with its characters existing in one of the many alternate universes outside the mainstream continuity known as the Marvel Universe.\n\nThe Razorline imprint consisted of four interrelated titles, based on Barker's detailed premises, titles and lead characters. These were:\n\n    Ectokid Ã¢â‚¬â€ written first by James Robinson, then by future Matrix co-creator Lana Wachowski (then known as Larry Wachowski), and penciled by Steve Skroce\n\n    Hokum &amp; Hex Ã¢â‚¬â€ written by Frank Lovece, penciled by Anthony Williams\n\n    Hyperkind Ã¢â‚¬â€ written by Fred Burke, penciled by Paris Cullins and inked by Bob Petrecca\n\n    Saint Sinner Ã¢â‚¬â€ written by Elaine Lee, penciled and inked by Max Douglas\n\nThe four titles were preceded by a one-shot sampler: Razorline: First Cut.\n\nThey all here, peeps! Praise to the creative teams, the scanners and to Mr. Barker.
