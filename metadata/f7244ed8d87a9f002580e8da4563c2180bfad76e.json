White Daisies\n\nRose Cousins is another artist from Halifax who enjoys a reputation in Canadian roots music circles, but who has yet to make much of a splash outside of the country. Up until now, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spent a lot of time supporting other artists such as the Juno winning performer, Joel Plaskett in his touring band or working in a group setting with Jill Barber and Meaghan Smith on a Christmas album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœA New Kind of LightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, to devote much time to her own career. As a result her own solo work has not received the attention that her talent merits. Hopefully, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to change with her third album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWe Have Made a Spark.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nLike Lucinda Williams and Mary Gauthier, Rose Cousins writes and performs songs that fit loosely into the country music genre but are not bound or hemmed in by its clichÃƒÂ©s. Her lyrics are close to the bone, reflecting a sense of loss, regret and forbearance without ever wallowing in the temptations and torpor of sentimentality that sink so many similar efforts. A single listen to the opening song Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe DarknessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with its deep and confident vocals riding over thumping banjo and bass lines should be enough for listeners to know that Rose Cousins has something special going on. With Ã¢â‚¬ËœWe Have Made a SparkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Rose Cousins proves she has one of the strongest and most emotive new voices on the country scene that when combined with the challenging, raw and uncompromising subject matter her songs reflect, are responsible for one of the most engaging albums of the year so far. Full of pain and hope, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWe Have Made a SparkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is an unexpectedly stunning album that begs to be heard.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7244ed8d87a9f002580e8da4563c2180bfad76e","amp;dn":"Rose+Cousins+-+We+Have+Made+a+Spark+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7244ed8d87a9f002580e8da4563c2180bfad76e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,36,78,216,216,122,159,0,37,128,232,218,69,99,194,24,11,250,215,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
