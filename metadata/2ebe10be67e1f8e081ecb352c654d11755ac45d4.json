The second episode called &quot;Once Upon a Time Machine&quot; was missing, as was the double length &quot;Planet of the Turtleoids&quot; episode, which should be numbered episodes 21 and 22 for that particular season.\n\nThe release of season 10 contained these missing episodes as special features, but none of the other torrents currently around have these episodes included as a rip. I downloaded the ISO for season 10 and ripped these episodes for my own use but decided to share them for your viewing pleasure.\n\nOf note: I'm not an encoder. I'm sure I could have packed the files smaller or in a better container. I don't particularly care myself. If you want to make them smaller, be my guest. Also: no subtitles are included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ebe10be67e1f8e081ecb352c654d11755ac45d4","amp;dn":"Teenage+Mutant+Ninja+Turtles+-+Missing+episodes+from+Season+5+DV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ebe10be67e1f8e081ecb352c654d11755ac45d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,190,16,190,103,225,248,224,129,236,179,82,198,84,209,23,85,172,69,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
