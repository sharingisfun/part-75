When the failed writer discovers that Oz really exists, he makes an error in judgment that brands him a criminal in two worlds. Can Frank save the day and redeem the Fizzle family name, or will the drizzly ghost of the Wicked Witch of the West destroy them all?\n\nThanks goes to Nothing and Binary for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b92f8a4bd9dc179825326c4db47fa5cc002318a0","amp;dn":"Royal+Historian+of+Oz+1-5+%282010-2011%29+%28Digital%29+%28Nothing-Novus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b92f8a4bd9dc179825326c4db47fa5cc002318a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,47,138,75,217,220,23,152,37,50,108,77,180,127,165,204,0,35,24,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
