The first issue of Southern Knights was called The Crusaders, but a trademark issue arose with Archie's Mighty Crusaders, so with the second issue the series was renamed Southern Knights. This was explained within the story by the heroes hitting a similar trademark issue and discovering another hero team in their universe is already called Crusaders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f18eb6f106e6df4d19a55a74767e27a53cbe766","amp;dn":"Southern+Knights+%231-36+%281982-1992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f18eb6f106e6df4d19a55a74767e27a53cbe766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,24,235,111,16,110,109,244,209,154,85,167,71,103,226,122,83,203,231,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
