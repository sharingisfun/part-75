Revanth is the only Grandmaster from India and gains worldwide fame when he becomes the world champion by beating Polonski, the reigning world champion. He returns to Bangalore where he works as an assistant executive for Kanara Advertising Service. Revanth is congratulated by all his colleagues including his boss and close friend James (Ramesh Bhat). He is, however, disappointed because he even though he has won an international tournament, he has absolutely no fans, very limited press coverage and no sort of recognition from the society. As he is expressing his disappointment to James, he gets a call from a lady who claims that she is his fan and is calling to congratulate him personally. However, she refuses to reveal her name, instead challenges Revanth to identify her within the next half an hour, with the only clue that her name starts with R. He takes up the challenge and comes up with lots of Indian names starting with R but is not able to identify her. The lady disconnects the call as she gets offended by some of the names suggested by Revanth Ã¢â‚¬â€ which were actually provided to Revanth by James.\n\n\n\nScreen Shots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/16/vlcsnap2013011218h56m34.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/16/vlcsnap2013011218h56m34.png/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/842/vlcsnap2013011218h56m46.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/842/vlcsnap2013011218h56m46.png/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/442/vlcsnap2013011218h56m55.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/442/vlcsnap2013011218h56m55.png/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/593/vlcsnap2013011218h57m02.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/593/vlcsnap2013011218h57m02.png/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7234cc3d376ebb1e92a0a148cb55d90d6029b031","amp;dn":"Beladingala+Baale+%281995%29+Kannada+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7234cc3d376ebb1e92a0a148cb55d90d6029b031","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,52,204,61,55,110,187,30,146,160,161,72,203,85,217,13,96,41,176,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
