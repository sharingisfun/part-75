Roland Kirk was vocalizing through his flute\n\nand playing whistles nearly a decade before &quot;TULL.&quot;  I like Tull too but flutewise\n\nit had been done before.\n\n\nKirk is most remembered for playing several &quot;horns&quot; at once.  The distinction\n\nhere is that he made it MUSICAL and could do it with ease in performance.\n\n\nThis guy had attitude.....MINGUS type attitude.  His way with the blues\n\nis so pure and unpredictable.  \n\n\nThese are my favorites from 8 or so CD's......I've left out the track which\n\nincludes 10 minutes of silence.........imagine buying a record that contained\n\na track of mostly silence......KIRK was unique.......we won't see another.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:656dd23ab52b15a25174893c0aa6448feb52a814","amp;dn":"Rahsaan+Roland+Kirk%2CWE+FREE+KINGS%2C1961%2C%2B2blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"656dd23ab52b15a25174893c0aa6448feb52a814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,109,210,58,181,43,21,162,81,116,137,60,10,166,68,143,235,82,168,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
