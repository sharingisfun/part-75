And the book might have been even ?larger, its editor, Robert Mankoff, writes. Of more than 68,000 pieces ?of art that could have been included in its pages, only about 2,000 have ?been printed on paper, while the rest are reproduced on two CD's ?attached to the inside of the front cover. The book is an astonishing ?object, still. The thought that all (or even just all the best) New ?Yorker cartoons can be gathered in one volume means that the set isn't ?infinite after all. It's like finding out there are only so many sad ?songs or only so many attractive blondes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a101b7a04c67cce3fe2d684063c9d6bf1f04046a","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+-+The+Complete+Cartoons+of+The+New+Yorker+%281925+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a101b7a04c67cce3fe2d684063c9d6bf1f04046a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,1,183,160,76,103,204,227,254,45,104,64,99,201,214,191,31,4,4,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
