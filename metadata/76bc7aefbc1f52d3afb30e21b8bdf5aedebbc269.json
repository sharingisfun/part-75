The year is 1968; Marc is adrift in the city after failing in his efforts to gain national acceptance for gay rights. One day, during a park pick-up, he meets Andre, a small town factory worker still exploring his sexuality but convinced that he will one day marry and start a family. Over the course of the next three years, Marc and Andre continue their heated affair as Marc continues to advocate fiercely for gay rights while butting heads with his close-minded father, a Paris police officer.\n\n\n\nEnglish hard-coded sub.\n\n\n\n01:13:18\n720x392\n29.97 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76bc7aefbc1f52d3afb30e21b8bdf5aedebbc269","amp;dn":"2005+Ma+Saison+Super+8+%5BMy+Super+8+Season%5D+%28FRA%29+%5BEngHSub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76bc7aefbc1f52d3afb30e21b8bdf5aedebbc269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,188,122,239,188,31,82,211,175,179,14,33,184,189,245,174,222,187,194,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
