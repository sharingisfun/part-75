Instead of incriminating herself, however, Kristen instead acts weepy and innocent. Kristen then reveals via a note that she is on to Marlena, who storms out. Later, John finds the tape and hears Kristen's revelation that Marlena was happy Brady was sleeping with her because that meant there would be no room for John in her bed. \n\nBrady runs into Nicole and later Daniel. Both express concern over his physical bruises and worry about him incurring emotional ones. John approaches his son but Brady insists his father must accept his relationship with Kristen. John refuses, and the two men remain estranged. Later, Brady is curious when he finds the torn pieces of Kristen's note to Marlena. \n\nChloe and Nicole cattily clash over their love for Daniel. While Nicole has moved on, Chloe moves forward with her plan to win him back. Meanwhile, Kate presses her agenda to discredit Chloe as a mother. She tries to get Jennifer to tell Daniel about Chloe's past as a prostitute. Chloe wants to deny Kate access to Parker, so she decides against telling Daniel herself what Kate did to her. She realizes she can score more points with him by &quot;putting Parker first&quot; and allowing Kate supervised visits. Later, Jennifer is poised to tell Daniel about Chloe - while Chloe gets the news from Nicole that Daniel may soon know the truth. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c489f9ce17bfcc39864b1e06348b44b73efdbcb","amp;dn":"Days+Of+Our+Lives+%7BThu%7D+1-17-2013.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c489f9ce17bfcc39864b1e06348b44b73efdbcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,72,159,156,225,123,252,195,152,100,177,224,99,72,180,75,115,239,219,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
