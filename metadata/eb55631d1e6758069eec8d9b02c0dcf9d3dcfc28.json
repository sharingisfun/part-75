Wainwright's \nsongwriting is every bit as strong on this collection as on her first album (no \nsmall achievement), and her skill at defining a character in words is impressive \nindeed, with uneven relationships dominating but not entirely defining the \nmany people Wainwright brings to life here. As a singer, she's gone from \nstrength to strength on I Know You're Married; sounding like some remarkable \nfusion of Kate Bush, Patti Smith, and Kate McGarrigle (the latter happens to \nbe her mom), Wainwright has learned how to draw out the drama from songs \nlike &quot;Comin' Tonight,&quot; &quot;Bleeding All Over You,&quot; and &quot;The George Song,&quot; though \nshe's intelligent enough to do so without sinking into melodrama. And while \nseveral different producers worked on this album (most notably Brad Alberta \nand Martin Terefe), the results have a rich, unified sound and feeling, with \nWainwright's powerhouse vocals luring the spotlight from a talented team of \nstudio collaborators (including Pete Townshend, Donald Fagen, Garth \nHudson, and Martha's brother Rufus) and meshing with arrangements that \ngracefully go from the spare to the grandiose. While much has been made of \nMartha Wainwright's place in a family of very talented musicians, I Know \nYou're Married But I've Got Feelings Too is the work of a singer and \nsongwriter who stands in no one's shadow and has fashioned a striking voice \nof her own, and that voice is in full and fascinating flight here.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb55631d1e6758069eec8d9b02c0dcf9d3dcfc28","amp;dn":"Martha+Wainwright+-+I+Know+You%27re+Married+But+I%27ve+Got+Feelings+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb55631d1e6758069eec8d9b02c0dcf9d3dcfc28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,85,99,29,30,103,88,6,158,236,141,155,2,192,220,249,211,220,252,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
