Abigail apologizes to Gabi saying this wouldn't have happened if she hasn't asked Chad to be her date. Chad says she heard Gabi tell Cameron that Nick isn't the father, a fact that Hope is beginning to believe. Will steps in and shocks everyone that he say he is the father not Nick. Sonny is horrified over the revelation of the secret Will's been keeping from him. Abigail scolds Chad and is surprised after she tells him about Will. Sami rips into Gabi for keeping Will's child away from her, prompting Rafe to warn her not to talk to her that way. Lucas stops Will before he can make things worse with Sonny, cause everything has changed now that he's a father. Hope tells Doug and Julie that Nick believes this arrangement can still work.
