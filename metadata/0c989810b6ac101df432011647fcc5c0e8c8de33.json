So, with a shrug, he makes the suspicion come true, then elbows his way into the editorship of the local paper in a small town where, opportunely, a sensational murder case threatens to destroy the family of newspaper magnate E.J. Stanton. When a black servant is made the patsy for this killing, Reese helps himself by helping her...but proves a dangerous ally.

Intentionally or not the line unscores the imminent blacklisting of The Underworld Story's costar Howard Da Silva plus the director and screenwriter.  The intriguing story is by Craig Rice, famed female mystery writer of the 40's and 50's who was the cover story subject of Time's January 1946 issue.&quot;\n\n\n  &quot;Craig Rice&quot; was the pseudonym of a woman writer working in this period.  I note this because it is so rare but not unique.  I have learned that Ida Lupino whose wiki is here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Lupino&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Lupino&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwas a writer, producer and director as well.  Why is this important?  Because unlike today the position of women in production as directors and writers was virtually unknown.  Lupino, for instance was a leiutenant in the ambulance corps in Britain during world war II which, it can be assumed, was where she learned how to give orders.  That experience,  translated to Hollywood,  meant the need to craft a glamour girl image while learning the craft of filmmaking.\n\nWhile not wanting to get into film enthusiasts' eccentricities, I think it is worthwhile to see films like The Underworld Story and various Ida Lupino films such as the one with my favorite title;  &quot;Private Hell Number 36&quot; and understand how women contributed to this popular style of noir/detective thrillers.\n\n\nNotes written December 28th 2012\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c989810b6ac101df432011647fcc5c0e8c8de33","amp;dn":"Underworld+Story+%281950%29+starring+Dan+Duryea+and+Gale+Storm+writt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c989810b6ac101df432011647fcc5c0e8c8de33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,152,152,16,182,172,16,29,244,50,1,22,71,252,197,192,232,200,222,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
