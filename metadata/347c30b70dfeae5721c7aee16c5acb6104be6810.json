While Reality's Coming Through has its share of pleading choruses and heartstring-tug power-chord changes (and genre spokesman Chris Carrabba guests on the rousing &quot;Unfaithful&quot;), this effort mostly suggests the resigned, flinty rock of Buffalo Tom, or vaguely the later Barlow/Loewenstein axis of Sebadoh. &quot;Fear the Sound&quot;'s wrangled guitars and struggling half-time, &quot;Cheap Trick&quot;'s clever musical references, the achy, pedal steel-tinged &quot;Best You Ever Knew&quot; - these songs don't deserve to be corralled behind the invisible fence of a meaningless genre. The presence of old-hand East Coast producer Tim O'Heir might have something to do with the blue-gray vibe of Reality's Coming Through, but there's that title, too, which suggests Hot Rod Circuit themselves know this album is the one. It might be the Let Me Come Over of this decade.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:347c30b70dfeae5721c7aee16c5acb6104be6810","amp;dn":"Hot+Rod+Circuit+-+Reality%27s+Coming+Through+%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"347c30b70dfeae5721c7aee16c5acb6104be6810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,124,48,183,13,254,174,87,33,199,174,225,108,90,203,97,4,190,104,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
