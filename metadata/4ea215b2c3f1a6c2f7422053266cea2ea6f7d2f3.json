The Death Of Country Music\n\nThe second chapter in the saga of Los Hermanos Wacos, Cowboy in Flames is widely regarded as THE perfect marriage of punk, liquor and roots. It's a wicked little skunk tossed into the tent of bloated, corrupt excesses. Making good on their promise (or was that a threat??) of their first record, the Wacos deliver a slab brimming with grim romanticism, and joyous, near ecstatic, drunken stomps. Join the cause as they strip the fat and greasepaint off country music's carcass and build a pagan temple out of its bones.\n\nIn addition to anthemic (and we don't bandy that word around lightly) originals like &quot;See Willy Fly By,&quot; the title track, &quot;Take Me to the Fires,&quot; &quot;Do What I Say,&quot; there are scalding versions of &quot;White Lightning,&quot; &quot;Wreck On The Highway,&quot; and &quot;Big River.&quot; This baby's got more classics on it than Get Your Ya's Ya's Out. We think you'll agree--Cowboy In Flames is a sure tonic to wash the taste of disgust out of a parched nation's throat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea215b2c3f1a6c2f7422053266cea2ea6f7d2f3","amp;dn":"Waco+Brothers+-+Cowboy+In+Flames+%5B1997%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea215b2c3f1a6c2f7422053266cea2ea6f7d2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,162,21,178,195,241,166,194,247,66,32,83,38,108,234,46,166,247,210,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
