They stick a dead body in his trunk, unbeknownst to him, and he roars off to find his future. Unfortunately, they forgot to get the key they need off the body, so they're chasing him. Meanwhile, a mafia kingpin's daughter is trying to kill the hitman that killed her father, but her grandmother is trying to make peace with the family that hired the hitman, so she and her thugs are trying to stop the daughter. The guy and the daughter get together and experience mayhem on the run from two directions.\n\nDirector: Jeffrey Reiner\n\nMichael Madsen............Harry Talbot \nPatricia Arquette.........Kit Califano \nSal Jenco.................Danny \nDarren Epton..............Raphael \nGregory Sporleder.........Irwin \nPaul Ben-Victor...........Zand\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105645/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105645/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf3cbf19f861f7ce76ed6d1220c2e9bd1e88ea8","amp;dn":"Trouble+Bound+%281993%29+DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf3cbf19f861f7ce76ed6d1220c2e9bd1e88ea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,243,203,241,159,134,31,124,231,110,214,209,34,12,46,155,209,232,142,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
