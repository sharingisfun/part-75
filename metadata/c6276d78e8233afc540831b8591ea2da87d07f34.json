Landing at Bangkok airport he meets his old pals John Walker and Gordon Goldman, who both have become successful international businessmen in Thailand.\n\nStraight to Pattaya, the city of sin, his friends promise him a vacation he'll never forget. JD quickly learns the ropes of the bar-life and is having the time of his life. His friends get a crisis-call from their biggest client, Mr. Suntory, and abruptly leave JD alone in the world's biggest red-light district. Not wanting to miss out on any fun, JD continues his heavy drinking until he passes out.\n\nHungover and thirsty, JD wakes up in the boiling hot jungle with no idea where he is and no memory of how he got there. With no mobile reception, no money and only Viagra in his pockets, JD starts his journey back to civilization. Battling both heat and humidity, he finds himself more and more on the brink of total meltdown, all the while getting mixed up in a dispute he understands nothing of.\n\n+------------------------\n|Plot outline:\n+------------------------\nIn this hard boiled feature length action thriller, J.D. is in Thailand to visit his old high school buddies, but after a hard night of partying and drinking, he suddenly finds himself lost in the burning hot jungle and must fight his way back to civilization.\n\n+------------------------\n|Credits:\n+------------------------\nDirector\t\t\t\tDANIEL  DAHL\nFirst Assistant Director\t\tWACHIRAPORN  KONNGOEN \nSecond Assistant Director\t\tKENNY  WANG\nThird Assistant Director\t\tKIM  ANDERSEN\n\nWritten by\t\t\t\tDANIEL DAHL\nScreenplay Supervisor\t\t \tKENNY  WANG\nStory\t\t\t\t\tDANIEL  DAHL\n\n\nExecutive Producer\t\t\tKENNY  WANG\nProducer\t\t\t\tDANIEL  DAHL\nAssociate Producer\t\t\tWACHIRAPORN  KONNGOEN\n \t\t\t\t\tELISABETH  HAGEBAKKEN\n\t\t\t\t\tKENNY  WANG\n\nCAST\nGordon Goldman\t\t\t\tDANIEL  DAHL\nJohn Walker\t\t\t\tKIM  ANDERSEN\nJD\t\t\t\t\tKENNY  WANG\nSuntory\t\t\t\t\tKITTIPAT  KARNKORD\nSuntory\t (Body Double)\t\t\tWISUT   PUSAVAN\nSuntory's Bodyguard\t\t\tOLE  STUBBERUD\nSuntory's Henchman\t\t\tNAVAKIT  CHAIDATE\n\n\n\nOfficial Website  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.killingheat.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.killingheat.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filmeliten.no/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filmeliten.no/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease support the making of extreme cool\nGet your genuine copy today @ http://buy.killingheat.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6276d78e8233afc540831b8591ea2da87d07f34","amp;dn":"Killing.Heat.2012.BluRay.720p.AC3.x264-KIANDE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6276d78e8233afc540831b8591ea2da87d07f34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,39,109,120,232,35,58,252,84,8,49,184,89,30,162,218,135,208,127,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
