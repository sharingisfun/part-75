Issued on the Argo label in 1964, these two albums are a prime example of soulful jazz organ from the time when funk was in its infancy. Both sets are further proof that if Willette hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been so underexposed, He certainly wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be quite so underrated.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01. Behind The 8 Ball\n02.
