Grab and run downloaders are forcing me to upload to ratios as high as 3.0 before there are enough stable seeds. That means up to two days to upload a torrent before I can start the next one. My upload bandwidth is modest. By not seeding, you're slowing yourselves down as well as everyone else.\n********************************************\n\nThis series is year by year (in the early years, decade by decade) sets of sci-films from 1900 to 1973. The series was originally posted on the late lamented Demonoid. The series creator was still creating and posting the sets when Demonoid shut down. The series is too good to be lost so I'm reposting it.\n\nI don't know whether these torrents include all sci-fi films released in a particular year; I'm just reposting them. It's my hope that the original poster will see these torrents being reposted and pick up where she/he left off.\n\nThe series is 46 files totaling 418GB. I can only seed a few at a time, so other users will have to continue seeding. I'll seed each torrent until it's well established, then post the next.
