Dylan began writing his own songs at eleven, and by his late teens, had developed a soulful, bluesy voice and guitar style that resonated with the sights and sounds of his musical youth. He released Paupers Field, his smoky, languid Townes Van Zandt- and Fleet Foxes-inspired debut, on Rough Trade in 2010 at the ripe old age of nineteen, followed by the likeminded Cast the Same Old Shadow in 2012.\n\n\nDylan LeBlanc's Rough Trade debut aches with the kind world-weary angst and faux-wisdom that serves as the foundation for countless other confessional singer/songwriters. That the Louisiana native is only 20 years old will have some crying foul, but this son of a Muscle Shoals session player has grown up watching his mentors exorcize their demons through music, so why shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t he? Paupers Field, a 12-track collection of slow, soulful country-folk, falls somewhere between Nick Drake, Jason Molina, Kelly Joe Phelps and Fleet Foxes. LeBlancÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smoky, emotive voice carries with it the reluctant ardor of his southern homeland, and his tales of love, life, loss and death feel real enough, if not duly informed by a lot of late nights nursing a pilfered bottle of bourbon over a stack of Neil Young and Townes Van Zandt records. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to deny the thick fog of finger-picked, '70s soft rock that hangs over Paupers Field, but standout cuts -- like the weepy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Emma Hartley,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Low,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death of Outlaw Billy John,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“If the Creek DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Rise,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the latter of which features effortless harmony vocals from none other than Emmylou Harris -- show a great deal of promise, especially when this old soul, saddled with the weight of a young manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preconceptions, finds those ideals both met and shattered. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.92% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRough Trade\nCatalogue #\t\tRTRADCD 590\t\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Low\n02.If Time Was For Wasting\n03.If The Creek Don't Rise\n04.Tuesday Night Rain\n05.Emma Hartley\n06.Ain't Too Good At Losing\n07.Changing Of The Seasons\n08.5th Avenue Bar\n09.On With The Night\n10.Coyote Creek\n11.Death Of Outlaw Billy John\n12.No Kind Of Forgiveness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec133e652b10c265855b2222ad0eca2fb0cf9e0d","amp;dn":"Dylan+LeBlanc+-+Paupers+Field+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec133e652b10c265855b2222ad0eca2fb0cf9e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,19,62,101,43,16,194,101,133,91,34,34,173,14,202,47,176,207,158,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
