I felt rather bad for using up a seat, especially once people were kicked out when the room was filled over capacity. But I enjoyed every minute of it. (Also has the best speaker intro ever. &quot;Schwern once typed git pull --hard and pulled GitHub's sever room across the street.&quot;)\n\n\nGit: Not Just for Source Code Anymore\n\nGood overview of the new ways to use git. Also kept giving examples from my body of work, which is some nice ego stroking, thanks Josh. ;-)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8afedb64e96952a9b81be33e472e11ee21979d5","amp;dn":"Git+talks+from+linux.conf.au","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8afedb64e96952a9b81be33e472e11ee21979d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,175,237,182,78,150,149,42,155,129,190,51,228,114,225,30,226,25,121,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
