From the Communist North to the U.S. supported\nSouth, it saw one nation brutally torn apart, and at the heart of it, one man.\nLt. Colonel John Paul Vann (Bill Paxton- Titanic, Twister, Apollo 13) is one of\nthe first U.S. senior military advisors sent to Vietnam. Vann is as complex as\nthe war itself- a husband and father who takes lovers as casually as he takes \ncontrol of every situation.....except one. In Vietnam, Vann finds himself fighting \na war he cannot win alongside a corrupt and demoralized South Vietnamese Army. \nBut what leads a man to expose the truth and sacrifice his career? To fly from \na loving home to a war-torn battlefield. To turn from a soldier of strategy to \na general of ruthless bombing campaigns which can only destroy what they cannot \ndefeat.\nA man- a time- a nation of change. What they share together and what tears them \napart is A BRIGHT SHINING LIE.\n\nFile Name: A Bright Shining Lie.avi\nFile Size (Bytes): 1,453,271,552\n\n[Format]\nFormat (Short Name): avi\nFormat (Long Name): AVI format\nDuration: 01:58:07.08\nDuration (Microseconds): 7,087,080,229\nBit Rate (bits/sec): 1,640,474\nNumber of Streams: 2\n\n[Stream #0]\nType: Video\nCodec (Short Name): mpeg4\nCodec (Long Name): MPEG-4 part 2\nCodec Tag: 0x44495658\nCodec Tag (String): XVID\nCodec Time Base: 1/29999\nTime Base: 1000000/29970029\nReal Base Frame Rate: 30000/1001\nAverage Frame Rate: 51998/1735\nDuration: 00:00:00.08\nDuration (Microseconds): 212,400\nBit Rate (bits/sec): N/A\nNumber of Frames: 212,400\n\nWidth: 640\nHeight: 480\nPixel Aspect Ratio: 1:1\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 4:3\nPixel Format: yuv420p\nHas B Frames: Yes\n\n[Stream #1]\nType: Audio\nCodec (Short Name): mp3\nCodec (Long Name): MP3 (MPEG audio layer 3)\nCodec Tag: 0x00000055\nCodec Tag (String): U[0][0][0]\nCodec Time Base: 0/1\nTime Base: 32/1225\nReal Base Frame Rate: 0/0\nAverage Frame Rate: 1225/32\nDuration: 00:00:00.08\nDuration (Microseconds): 271,301\nBit Rate (bits/sec): 128,000\nNumber of Frames: 271,301\n\nChannels: 2\nSample Rate (Hz): 44,100\nBit Rate: 16 bits (Integer)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a19882308ccb01986139da455b8fee6363cf49b8","amp;dn":"A+Bright+Shining+Lie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a19882308ccb01986139da455b8fee6363cf49b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,152,130,48,140,203,1,152,97,57,218,69,91,143,238,99,99,207,73,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
