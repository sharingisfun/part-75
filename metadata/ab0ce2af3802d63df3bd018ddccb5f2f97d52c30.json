There are other good Torrents with a good speed if you want to download the whole Secret Invasion. X-Factor participation is small.\n\nFollowing what happens in Messiah Complex, there is another small Arc named Second Coming but the participation of X-Factor is small too. (I can upload it too, just ask) \n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, help me to seed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The scans are not mine, I am just gathering them in one Torrent. Special thanks for the uploaders that worked so hard on this serie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab0ce2af3802d63df3bd018ddccb5f2f97d52c30","amp;dn":"X-Factor+V3+%231+to+%23249","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab0ce2af3802d63df3bd018ddccb5f2f97d52c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,12,226,175,56,2,214,61,243,189,1,141,220,203,95,47,151,213,44,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
