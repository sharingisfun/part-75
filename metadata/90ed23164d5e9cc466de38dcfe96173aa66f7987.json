In one example of the rich and magical world Kennedy serves \nup in four stories (totaling more than an hour of storytelling with one brief \nIrish musical interlude), pigs can't stop dancing (&quot;Annie O'Reilly and the Magic \nDancing Pig&quot;). Of course, underlying this 16-minute fable is a sly critique, as \nthe king of England wants this prized pig as his own and is wont to take \nthings, but the pig eludes royal grasp. Kennedy proves again she's an \naccomplished seanachie (that's Gaelic for storyteller). Her voice is rich, warm, \nand musical as she spins imaginative foibles such as Tommy O'Rourke's visit to \nthe moon, or as she delightfully relates an abridged version of the old \nBeowulf yarn in &quot;Finn McCool.&quot; In the age of Harry Potter's magical \nadventures--and way too much TV watching--here's a grand listening \nexercise for children that will capture their heads and hearts while hopefully \nhelping to keep their ears on. --Martin Keller\n\nProduct Description\nSharon Kennedy's tales take children to a world of giants and kings, magical \njourneys and dancing pigs. It's a world where cleverness counts and where \nmight doesn't make right. Following up her award-winning album Irish Folk \nTales for Children, the Grammy-nominated storyteller presents four more \ntales from the rich Irish tradition. Irish music weaves in and out of the stories, enhancing the spell which Sharon Kennedy casts. &quot;You'll hang on every word of Sharon Kennedy, an Irish American whose ear for the auld sod's brogue is \nas unerring as her instinct for an engrossing yarn.&quot; -Moira McCormick, Family \nFun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90ed23164d5e9cc466de38dcfe96173aa66f7987","amp;dn":"Sharon+Kennedy+-+More+Irish+Folk+Tales+For+Children+%5Bflac%5D+stori","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90ed23164d5e9cc466de38dcfe96173aa66f7987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,237,35,22,77,94,156,196,102,222,56,220,254,150,23,58,166,111,121,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
