The game realistically depicts tank warfare in North Africa during World War 2. Players may choose any of the belligerents for each mission. In depth planning is key to defeating the enemy-- no John Rambos here.\n\nThis is a really rare game because it was only released in EU and Japan. It's an even RARER torrent, so please seed.\n\nThis is an iso file. Works good on pc emulator. Should be burnable.\n\nPlease comment if their is a problem. I shall aid you as best I can.\n\nEnjoy and good luck, the deserts of North Africa are an unforgiving place.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feff5a57a35bdedfb3dd87d700d684b0fe1c3f73","amp;dn":"Panzer+Front+Ausf.B+%5BENG%5D%5BPAL%5D%5BPS2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feff5a57a35bdedfb3dd87d700d684b0fe1c3f73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,255,90,87,163,91,222,223,179,221,135,215,0,214,132,176,254,28,63,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
