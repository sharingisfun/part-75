Much has changed   \n  since Omi ran away from home a decade         \n  back after stealing money from his doting     \n  grandfather, Darji. The old man has since     \n  become senile and most importantly, forgotten \n  the secret recipe of &quot;Chicken Khurana&quot; a      \n  dish that made the Khurana dhaba  famous      \n  across Punjab. Omi's childhood sweetheart,    \n  Harman is soon to be married to his cousin,   \n  Jeet, though neither seems too happy about it.\n  Adding to the quirkiness of the Khurana family\n  is a free loader uncle, Titu, who once did    \n  a stint at a mental asylum. Will Omi be able t\n  cover his deceit and lies for long, even as   \n  he tries to recover the lost recipe of        \n  Chicken Khurana - the family's only hope      \n  to reclaim their pride &amp; wealth.              \n                                                \n                                                \n   IMDB Link :                                  \n                                                \n     &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2186933/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2186933/&lt;/a&gt;      \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/1503/15372623.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/1503/15372623.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2046/97626673.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2046/97626673.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/9180/41922099.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/9180/41922099.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/534/54304315.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/534/54304315.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6106/40990088.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6106/40990088.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/9697/46568459.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/9697/46568459.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cefd4612cbcd1f7585ba3780c61ee06ec1edbf5d","amp;dn":"Luv+Shuv+Tey+Chicken+Khurana+-+1080p+-+Blu-Ray+-+x264+-+DTS+%5BDDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cefd4612cbcd1f7585ba3780c61ee06ec1edbf5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,253,70,18,203,205,31,117,133,186,55,128,198,30,224,110,193,237,191,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
