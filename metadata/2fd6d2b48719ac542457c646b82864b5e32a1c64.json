Carnally Minded People Are Most Susceptible to Brain Washing, And This Insiduious Influence Is Not Only In Advertizing and Medial Slpin, It's In the Church As Well.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nTell The Truth by Zeph Daniel:\nZeph Daniel; &quot;It is so obvious to me those of the truth and those who live a total lie unto their way Satan (but lie about it)... the LEFT is the lie... perhaps the extreme right is too... but those who are independent, just truth-dwellers, are in fact HEAVEN DWELLERS, and those of GOD, versus the EARTH DWELLERS who bring the LEFTIST NWO. They are DEMONIC and pervasive, who brought you political correctness, false-flag terror... does not mean that Republican ruling class persons are not also LEFTISTS--they are. Communism is SATANISM. Statism is Satanism&quot;.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Door Was Shut; For Every Truth - Philip Sizemore:\nThe parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25 gives us a picture of what will happen just prior to Christ's Second Coming -- some people will try to get into heaven, but the door of probation will shut because they did not obey the truth they professed to believe. Join Pastor Philip Sizemore as he analyzes the symbolism of this parable and its urgent message to all people today.
