In 1996,\neverything that had previously been published, along with a bounty of new material, was updated\nand compiled into a book. From 1996 until 2004, several new editions of the book were produced.\nWith each new version, a decrease in font size correlated to an increase in information. The task of\nrevising the book grew continually larger. Two attempts to create an updated fifth edition both\nfizzled out. I finally accepted that keeping on top of all of the new books, businesses, and\norganizations, had become a more formidable challenge than I wished to take on. In any case, these\ndays folks can find much of what they are looking for by simply using an Internet search engine.\nEven though much of the PRL is now extremely dated, it occurred to me that there are two reasons\nwhy making it available on the web might be of value. First, despite the fact that a good deal of the\nbookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content describes things that are no longer extant, certainly some of the content relates to\nwritings that are still available and businesses or organizations that are still in operation. The\nopinions expressed regarding such literature and groups may remain helpful for those who are\nattempting to navigate the field for solid resources, or who need some guidance regarding whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nbest to avoid. Second, the book acts as a snapshot of underground culture at a particular point in\nhistory. As such, it may be found to be an enjoyable glimpse of the psychedelic scene during the late\n1990s and early 2000s.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Jon Hanna, February 2009 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe78d8c86d53db8a1779d59b94e81f5444c7446","amp;dn":"psychedelic+resource+list+Jon+Hanna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe78d8c86d53db8a1779d59b94e81f5444c7446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,231,141,140,134,213,61,184,161,119,157,89,185,78,129,245,68,76,116,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
