While neither seem to do anything constructive with their lives, they are involved in several misadventures, mostly resulting in a non sequitur ending. The following episode will feature no mention of previous encounters.\nThe pair (or frequently, Robin alone) will have run-ins with the law, encounter drunks, flashers and other odd characters\n\nBritish band Radiohead saw Robin on Channel 4 and approached Magnus Carlsson to make a video for their song &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; with Robin in it. Carlsson accepted and came up with the original idea for the video after locking himself in his office, staring out the window at a bridge and listening to nothing but Paranoid Android repeatedly.\nDuring the video of Paranoid Android, the band makes a cameo appearance at a bar, where they are sitting at a table drinking and watching a person with a head coming out of his stomach dancing on their table.\nIn 2006, Carlsson made the music video for dance act Daddy DJ.

The video shows a man who works as a DJ, and whose son watches him via webcam, before his dad gets a recording contrac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06c26cac09248b3c3ee0af627cdfa1431780e994","amp;dn":"Robin.1996.Magnus.Carlsson.TV.RIP.ENG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06c26cac09248b3c3ee0af627cdfa1431780e994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,194,108,172,9,36,139,60,62,224,175,98,124,223,161,67,23,128,233,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
