Canada\n\n\n\nThose who have followed the meteoric rise of DETROIT DIESEL, or read the credits of the seminal debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Terre HumaineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, might recall the name of former member Clutch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who parted company with the band shortly before the release of that first album. \nIf you are one of those who wondered Ã¢â‚¬Å“So whatever happened to that guy?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ then wonder no longer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ wonder only at the sheer adrenaline rush unleashed on his new trio NITRONOISEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own first album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Total NihilismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \n\nHailing from Montreal - and about to make their live debut at no less an event than Kinetik 5 in their hometown - for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Total NihilismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ NITRONOISE takes the sound palette of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Terre HumaineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ plus equal parts NACHTMAHR and COMBICHRIST and throws some guitars into the mix for good measure.\n \nRounded out with a hard dance version by STUDIO-X, a rock remix from ALIEN VAMPIRES and a club smasher from NOISUF-X, this is one of the essential new albums and new faces we introduce this Spring! \nNITRONOISE will get under your skin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just let me in, sweet adrenalineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n \nTracklist:\n1.
