Hudnall. It centered on a disparate group of people with various psychic powers who are brought together under duress and later coalesce as a team. Espers was published intermittently in the 1980s and 1990s by four different companies, including Eclipse, Marvel, and Image, and was re-numbered from issue 1 again each time.\n\nIt was ultimately moved to Marvel Comics' Epic imprint, where eight issues were published under the title &quot;Interface&quot; from 1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1991. The first six issues of that series, featuring painted art by Paul Johnson, re-introduced the main characters and re-told the story from the original &quot;Espers&quot; 4-issue story arc in flashback form, before picking up the &quot;Liquidators&quot; story line that had begun in issue #5 from Eclipse. \n\nThe next six issues were published by Hudnall's own company, Halloween Comics, before moving to Image for seven issues. I'm working on getting the Image issues but it's slooooooooow going on an old DCP/Minuteman torrent. If anyone has the Halloween and/or Image issues, please please upload them!\n\nGet it, seed it. All praise to the creative teams and original scanners!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10eefa6ad389fa65a6bd2396b97977176c17c7ed","amp;dn":"Interface+%28epic+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10eefa6ad389fa65a6bd2396b97977176c17c7ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,238,250,106,211,137,250,101,166,189,35,150,185,121,119,23,108,23,199,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
