As super predators they are a natural part of the landscape and ecosystem and are deeply embedded in many of our famous myths and legends.\n\nIn this documentary series, Dr. Ãƒâ€°amonn Ãƒâ€œ Ciardha looks at our complex relationship with the Wolf, taking us on a hair raising journey into Ireland's past, exploring the background to what many of us experience as an instinctive fear of the Wolf or Mac TÃƒÂ­re - son of the land. A land that was in increasing turmoil at the turn of the 16th century as plantation settlers began to arrive. For them, the wolf became a fearsome symbol of this wild and dangerous land.\n\nLarge-scale farming and deforestation saw the wolf rapidly losing its hunting and breeding grounds. But war, rebellion and fighting between settlers and a growing number of Irish rebels provided rich pickings for wolves - preying on livestock and scavenging on the fallen. The terrified settlers called their new home &quot;Wolfland&quot;.\n\nThe first programme in the series looks at the traces and tracks the wolf has left with us in Ireland, within the landscape and place names, the language, the literature and the mythology. Roaming the land for some 20,000 years the wolf was certainly feared, but also revered in Ireland. It was a creature that symbolised strength and courage to the native Irish, but to the arriving settlers from the 16th century onwards the wolf was a dark and savage creature representing all that needed tamed in Ireland.\n\nIn the second programme we look at the escalating fighting between the settlers and the Irish as mass plantations began across Ireland and the role the wolf played in the bloody warfare of the Cromwellian era. Documentary evidence is uncovered of early propaganda linking the rebel Irish, the catholic priest and the savage wolf and of a campaign to rid Ireland of all three.\n\nFilmed across Ireland, this series is a fascinating mix of Irish history and natural history. A compelling look at the plantation era, charting the importance of the wolf in Ireland's history and its ultimate extinction.\n\nFile info                                : Wolfland Part 1 [HQ PDTV] [RTE] [x264 AC3] DeViL303.mkv\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFile size                                : 268 MiB\nDuration                                 : 25mn 1s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 497 Kbps\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2013-02-19 12:07:46\nWriting application                      : mkvmerge v2.5.3 ('Boogie') built on Mar  7 2009 15:00:41\nWriting library                          : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bef6d7d9d6fef28d908e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 3 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 25mn 1s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 1 303 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 12.0 Mbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nOriginal display aspect ratio            : 5:4\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nStandard                                 : PAL\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.126\nStream size                              : 228 MiB (85%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 93 r1542M 5b86182\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:-1:-1 / \n\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : A_AC3\nDuration                                 : 25mn 1s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 34.4 MiB (13%)\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e229f79f755e06819ec325ec2a473dec9939bb80","amp;dn":"Wolfland+Part+1%2B2+%5BAs.Gaeilge%5D+%5BRTE+Ireland%5D+HQ+PDTV+x264+AC3+De","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e229f79f755e06819ec325ec2a473dec9939bb80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,41,247,159,117,94,6,129,158,195,37,236,42,71,61,236,153,57,187,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
