With every synapse crackling, Eddie can recall everything he has ever read, seen or heard, learn any language in a day, comprehend complex equations and beguile anyone he meets - as long as he keeps taking the untested drug. Soon Eddie takes Wall Street by storm, parlaying a small stake into millions. His accomplishments catch the eye of mega-mogul Carl Van Loon, who invites him to help broker the largest merger in corporate history. But they also bring Eddie to the attention of people willing to do anything to get their hands on his stash of NZT. With his life in jeopardy and the drug's brutal side effects taking their toll, Eddie dodges mysterious stalkers, a vicious gangster and an intense police investigation as he attempts to hang on to his dwindling supply long enough to outwit his enemies.\n\nCast:\n    Bradley Cooper as Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Morra\n    Robert De Niro as Carl Van Loon\n    Abbie Cornish as Lindy\n    Anna Friel as Melissa Gant\n    Johnny Whitworth as Vernon Gant\n    Robert John Burke as Don Pierce\n    Tomas Arana as the Man in a tan coat\n    T.V.
