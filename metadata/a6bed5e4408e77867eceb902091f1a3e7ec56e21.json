The topics and techniques covered in this workshop include Ã¢â‚¬Å“Awakening the EthradonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (the fourth Ã¢â‚¬Ëœradon cellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ activation), Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Arc of the Covenant of LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rainbow BridgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the Psonns of Passage and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“SEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢- da celebration circlesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ethason allianceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½,  the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ra-Sha-LAÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Um-Shaddh-EieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, purging the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tauren BodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“InorganicsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“CALOR forceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Taming the TaurenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and related techniques, the Arametena Passage, the Ashalum chamber, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ra-Sha-HallahÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ra-Sha-LAÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ &amp; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ra-Sha-LA-ahÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bodies, the Veils of the Ra-Sha-Hallah, the Seals of the Ra-Sha-LA, the Transcendental passages and finally, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trans-identity ConsciousnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nExquisite footage in this workshop will take the viewer on a journey with Team Indigo through MoroccoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s glorious mountain deserts, Atlas Mountains, sweeping plains, bustling sea-side communities and colorful market places while they join the Emerald Covenant races in fulfilling the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rainbow-Bridge MissionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, also known as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Covenant of LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Team Indigo commences this mission with the introduction of the wonderful Songs of the Rainbow-Bridge, songs with origins in the English, Eieyani, AdonA and HaahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢TUr languages. Join the Team as they travel throughout Morocco on an Ã¢â‚¬Å“official ambassadorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tour, singing the Sacred SE-da Songs,and in doing so, assist the Guardian races in reuniting the 12 Human Races, referred to at this workshop for the first time, as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“12 Ray-saÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ray-Sa = carrier of the RAYS). Many Moroccans (particularly the Berbers) have ancient connections to the Kantarians and the long lost Procyone Races of Sirius C and many are still the Ã¢â‚¬Å“keepers of the Ethradon Seal KeysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that activate specific Earth grids in Morocco. Team IndigoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presence and activities in Morocco during the Ethradon awakening in turn assists in the activation of these Ethradon Seal keys which in turn sets the final Ethradon Awakening in motion (the final of the four Ã¢â‚¬Å“Radon cellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ activations which have included the Nadradon, Zendradon and Kethradon awakenings). This workshop covers the information on the relationship between the Ethradon awakening and the anchoring of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ashalum PassageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, another passage needed in addition to the Arametana pathway and the Rama and Polarian Gate systems to ensure a successful planetary Starburst process.\n\nIn this workshop, the viewer is introduced to valuable new information on the true nature of our Ã¢â‚¬Å“perceptual filtersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and how the activities of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tauren BodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (also known as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Demon WithinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and originator of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“GlamourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), the metatronic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Calor ForceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Ã¢â‚¬Å“inorganicsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Out of Control AspectsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (OOCA) within our crystal bodies can exacerbate the prejudice, fear and suspicion generated by our perceptual filters. There is also information on the origins and consequences of the Tauren Body and importantly, techniques on how to Ã¢â‚¬Å“tame the TaurenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ within us, particularly when experiencing emotional turmoil. The techniques involve use of our newly birthed Ra-Sha-LA body (our Monadic Selves) to assist in clearing the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Calorene ForceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in our surroundings, belongings and in loved ones (while observing strict Kristic protocols). The techniques also involve the use of powerful 3-point activationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ breaths and both encrypted and unencrypted E-Cou-Sha-crystal replicas. Another important technique introduced at this workshop is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“SadhiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sleep state, a state where one can take short physical rest periods (after the Dial-up) for Ã¢â‚¬ËœrefreshmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of energy levels and to receive transmissions from our Christos levels and higher. Finally, this workshop introduces more of the fascinating anatomy of the Monad and its formation through the complex interaction of phasing of the 1st and 2nd Partiki that characterize God Source. This anatomy encompasses the First creational Sound Tones associated with the first in-breaths and out-breaths of God Source consciousness and which have Ã¢â‚¬ËœevolvedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ into the many of the Sacred Sound tones and words that we know today, such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“TRa-Na-TiEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or as we know it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“TrinityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This same anatomy encompasses the structure of the Inner Hub Worlds, also known as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“BudÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Worlds, home to the High Council Hub Masters, the HaahTUrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, (Founders and Guardian Races from the Eckasha-A level of Creation) and from which all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“OuterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ God Worlds originate. Comes with 12 page supplement containing the Psonns of Passage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6bed5e4408e77867eceb902091f1a3e7ec56e21","amp;dn":"The+Ethradon+Awakening","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6bed5e4408e77867eceb902091f1a3e7ec56e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,190,213,228,64,142,119,134,126,206,185,2,9,31,26,62,126,197,110,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
