In addition, in the Alpha book, you can find invaluable advice about how to reprogram your way of thinking, your behaviour towards others and eventually your life.\n\nEnjoy! And find if you are One of Us...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is Alienology?\n\nAlienology is a modern religion based on the first religion that mankind endorsed and offers a precise path leading to full understanding of the purpose of the human race and the true origins of Aliens.\n\nAlienology concentrates on the genetic potentiality and believes that many human beings are lost members of the family that existed thousands years ago before the existence of the first Homo sapiens species.\n\nTo separate Homo sapiens from Aliens, there is only one path. The reality of the contact between the Alien Gods and their descendents, the Aliens.\n\nThe purpose of the Alienology is to find the lost members of the Family (as mentioned before), guide them in order to distinguish the truth from the lie and eventually make them remember their original heritage.\n\nThe teachings are not ideas to he collected, but a path to be followed.\n\nThe potential Alienologist knows that:\n\nHis experience of the contact with extraterrestrial entities is real.\n\nThe difference between the entities perceived as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“grey onesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the real Aliens.\n\nAlienology will offer a new way of thinking and living within modern society and can improve everyday life mentally and bodily. It is not a twist of fate that Alienologists live longer than the average human being and are successful concerning their jobs, public image and interpersonal relationships.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8810c0c31befd48a0a146b19d3464e366cc1f87","amp;dn":"Temple+of+Alienology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8810c0c31befd48a0a146b19d3464e366cc1f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,129,12,12,49,190,253,72,160,161,70,177,157,52,100,227,102,204,31,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
