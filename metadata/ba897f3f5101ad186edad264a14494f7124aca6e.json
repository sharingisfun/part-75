These divergent influences come together splendidly in Bon AppÃƒÂ©tit, Y'all, a modern Southern chef's passionate and utterly appealing homage to her culinary roots. Espousing a simple-is-best philosophy, Virginia uses the finest ingredients, concentrates on sound French technique, and lets the food shine in a style she calls &quot;refined Southern cuisine.&quot; More than 200 approachable and consistently delicious recipes are arranged by chapter into starters and nibbles; salads and slaws; eggs and dairy; meat, fowl, and fish main dishes; sides; biscuits and breads; soups and stews; desserts; and sauces and preserves. Collected here are stylishly updated Southern and French classics (New SouthernChicken and Dumplings, Boeuf Bourgignonne), rib-sticking, old-timey favorites (Meme's Fried Okra, Angel Biscuits), and perfectly executed comfort food (Mama's Apple Pie, Fried Catfish Fingers with Country RÃƒÂ©moulade). Nearly 100 photographs bring to life both Virginia's food and the bounty of her native Georgia. You'll also find a wealth of tips and techniques from a skilled and innovative teacher, and the stories of a Southern girl steeped to her core in the food, kitchen lore, and unconditional hospitality of her culinary forebears on both sides of the Atlantic. Bon AppÃƒÂ©tit, Y'all is Virginia's way of saying, &quot;Welcome to my Southern kitchen. Pull up a chair.&quot; Once you have tasted her food, you'll want to stay a good long while.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba897f3f5101ad186edad264a14494f7124aca6e","amp;dn":"Virginia+Willis+%26amp%3B+Ellen+Silverman+-+Bon+Appetit%2C+Y%27all+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba897f3f5101ad186edad264a14494f7124aca6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,137,127,63,81,1,173,24,110,218,210,100,161,68,148,247,18,74,202,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
