As a reflection of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtask at handÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in getting the physical body ready to slide, these techniques included physical body sounds, movements and rhythms (Phase-Toning), in addition to the usual see/feel visualization kind of techniques. These new and exciting technologies will begin enabling us to shift our 3D conscious state into a more expanded conscious state. To prepare us for this shift, this workshop covers information on our very own embodied Kara-nAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢dis Seal, the Aah-JhAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Hydro-Acoustic Body, the D-2 Control GrUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-al (Ã¢â‚¬ËœGrailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) Window, the Dimensional Penta-gÃ¢â‚¬â„¢el circulations (within the D-1 Jhandas, the D-2 GrUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-al, the D-3 TEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢a-Wha and D-4 Jha-Dha windows) and the Ã¢â‚¬ËœI AMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bands of consciousness.\n\nThese amazing Sliders-2 techniques will assist us in opening the communication between the D1, D2, D3 and Density-1 Ã¢â‚¬ËœI AMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ levels of consciousness, allowing our Ã¢â‚¬ËœI AMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ levels to communicate with each other and also allowing us to more fully reunite with our own embodied natural GhaRE Spirit. To assist us in this process, this workshop includes a Ã¢â‚¬ËœDaily GrailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ technique program with instructions on how to clear our food of both the unnatural GharocheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and natural GharEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and how to re-enliven it. It also includes the wonderful new phase-toning techniques that teach us to listen to The Voice of our own embodied Spirit, GhaREÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, so we can gradually become The Voice of our embodied Spirit.\n\nThis program also includes important information on foot baths, dietary changes and exercise Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ how much, how often, what sort and mostly importantly, why. There is also more information on the amazing 12 Steps of Materialization (plasm, protoplasm, vapors, metallic electroplasma, hydroplasma, thermoplasma, ectoplasma - includes celestallon, celestalline and celestallite Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and finally endoplasma water-matter) and the fascinating manifestation and materialization process that takes place in the RaSha Body, Light Body (in the etheric duct system), Spirit Body and Aah-JhA Body. Finally, join Team Indigo for the exhilarating Wave of Sacred Psonns (including several beautiful new songs) for the International Day of Peace-Fall Equinox and bringing in the Host of Al-benÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-yhan.\n\nTechniques in order of presentation in this workshop include:\n\n    Sliders-1 Technique &amp; Sliders-2 Prep Technique-A, B &amp; C\n\n    Optical-Pineal Induction of the Allur-EÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ah Ra-sha-tan Protoplasm Code\n\n    Creating the TEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢a-Wha Materialization Seed.\n\n    Opening the Pentagonal TEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢a-Wha WINDOW &amp; Conscious Materialization\n\n    Psonns of the Sacred Wave: Calling of the 6 Directions and the Host of Al-ben-Yhan; International Day Of Peace-Fall Equinox; The Hour of Requiem\n\n    Sliders-2  PSI-Interactive Technique-1: Activating the Grail Window- Part-1&amp;2\n\n    Sliders-2 PSI-Interactive Technique-2: I AM THE VOICE - Phase-Toning\n\n    Sliders-2 PSI-Interactive Technique-3A-E: Entering the Grail (GrUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢al) State (70 steps; 90 minutes)\n\n    Sliders-2: Activation of the Median Earth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ascension Earth Grail Window (on beach)\n\n    Sliders-2: PSI-Interactive Technique-4A-E: Opening the Grail Door\n\n    Sliders-2: Journey to the Keivas (Median Earth hydrolase pools)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aebc85b0c0740cab3f95e834b64bbf3833f7e065","amp;dn":"Sliders+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aebc85b0c0740cab3f95e834b64bbf3833f7e065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,188,133,176,192,116,12,171,63,149,232,52,182,75,191,56,51,247,224,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
