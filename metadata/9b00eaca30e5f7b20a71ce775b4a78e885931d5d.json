It originated in the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as &quot;emotional hardcore&quot; or &quot;emocore&quot; and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. As the style was echoed by contemporary American punk rock bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed, blending with pop punk and indie rock and encapsulated in the early 1990s by groups such as Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate. By the mid-1990s numerous emo acts emerged from the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b00eaca30e5f7b20a71ce775b4a78e885931d5d","amp;dn":"Essential+Emo+%281985-2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b00eaca30e5f7b20a71ce775b4a78e885931d5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,0,234,202,48,229,247,178,10,113,206,119,91,74,120,232,133,147,29,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
