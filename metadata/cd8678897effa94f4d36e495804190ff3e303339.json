He is full of exciting energy that makes crowds go wild. He headlines all over the country, putting his heart and soul into every performance with an act that is brash, deep and most importantly, funny. Adam is one of the hardest working comics around, performing every night of the week, usually 2 or 3 shows a night.\n\n-----------------\n\nThis is the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #309 64k Time Warped version. Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG Vorbis aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd8678897effa94f4d36e495804190ff3e303339","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23309+-+Adam+Hunter+%5B64k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd8678897effa94f4d36e495804190ff3e303339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,134,120,137,126,255,169,79,77,54,228,149,128,65,144,255,62,48,51,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
