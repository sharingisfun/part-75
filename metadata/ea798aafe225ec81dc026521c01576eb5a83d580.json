During the first setbreak, golfers came on stage and hit soft golf balls into the crowd.  Light contained an Auld Lang Syne tease.  You Enjoy Myself contained a Birds of a Feather tease.  Trey, Page and Mike came out for the third set in golf carts and began hitting golf balls into the crowd. Fish then arrived on a golf cart wearing donut pants and shirt, an argyle vest, and a golf hat.  Golf carts were brought back on stage during Kung, then began racing past the stage periodically   More and more golf carts joined the marathon.  During the Chalkdust jam, golfers began getting out of the carts, hitting balls into the crowd and dancing on stage.  One of the golfers did the New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s countdown from on top of a cart.  Ping pong balls were fired from cannons during Auld Lang Syne.  Tweezer Reprise featured a number of backup singers.  Iron Man was preceded by Page coming to the front of the stage in a jacket, USS Nimitz ball cap and holding a golf club to wish the crowd Happy New Year and reference the start of the 30th year of Phish. This show featured the Phish debuts of Garden Party and Fly Like an Eagle as well as the first full Phish performance of Iron Man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea798aafe225ec81dc026521c01576eb5a83d580","amp;dn":"Phish-+2012-12-31-+MSG+4+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea798aafe225ec81dc026521c01576eb5a83d580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,121,138,175,226,37,236,129,220,2,101,33,192,21,118,235,90,131,213,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
