Cue)\nlossless\nTotal Size File: 3.1 Gb\nGenre: Rock, Glam Rock, Hard Rock\n\nIn 1973, KISS signed its first record deal with the newly-formed Casablanca Records. KISS was the first band signed to the upstart label, which helped launch the success of the hottest band in the world.\n\nAfter seeing KISS play a showcase concert at Le Tang's ballet studio, Casablanca founder Neil Bogart quickly offered KISS a record contract. From 1974 to 1982, Casablanca Records released 29 KISS singles on 45rpm vinyl records. These singles were released for sale to the public, used for commercial radio airplay and to promote album sales. In many cases, as a bonus to the fans who already owned the record albums, many of these singles featured entirely different mixes, edits, and material that did not appear on any album. These musical snapshots of KISS' formative years have never before been released in a commemorative singles edition.\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1:\n01. NothinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ To Lose 03:28\n02.
