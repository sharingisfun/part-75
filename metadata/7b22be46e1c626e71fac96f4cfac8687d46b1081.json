Seriously.\n\nSo why would I make a torrent out of it? Because I've yet to find a better PDF for this particular book, and 'something' is slightly better than 'nothing.' (It's like a busted-up library book, but without the aura of pestilence.)\n\n\nI fiddled around with pdftk for a few minutes to see if could improve the error situation. Alas, no go. (And, I'll be honest, I didn't try for long.)\n\nSo if you find a better PDF of this book, please use it instead, and pretend this torrent never existed. Until then, at least you can see what the end-of-chapter exercises are, that you were assigned for class. (Hopefully. I didn't actually check to see if those pages were all error-free.)\n\n\n\n&quot;The internet is the global library.&quot; - My future Lich","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b22be46e1c626e71fac96f4cfac8687d46b1081","amp;dn":"PMBOOK7476.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b22be46e1c626e71fac96f4cfac8687d46b1081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,34,190,70,225,198,38,231,31,172,150,244,207,172,134,135,212,107,16,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
