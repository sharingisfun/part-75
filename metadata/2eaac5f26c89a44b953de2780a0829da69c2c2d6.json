Thus, with few exceptions, the stories progressed forward in the Star Wars prequel-era timeline to mimic where the movies were. In late 2005, they even pushed forward slightly into the early inter-trilogy period, before the title stopped in early 2006. This publication halt had little to do with the inherent popularity of the book, but with LucasBooks' desire to preserve most of the inter-trilogy period for exploration by a proposed 2008 television program. Over the course of its 80+ issue run, the series divided itself neatly into 2-6-issue arcs, most of which were later republished in trade paperback form. Though all the major players of the prequel era have had at least one story in which they were the &quot;stars&quot;, the usual stars of the book were Dark Horse's own creations, Jedis Aayla Secura and Quinlan Vos. Vos proved so popular, in fact, that his &quot;final&quot; status was left unresolved by the series. LucasBooks allowed readers to believe that he had survived Episode III's &quot;Order 66&quot;. His padawan, Aayla Secura, was not so lucky, as she was seen to be murdered in Episode III.\nThis title was considered to be the main home of prequel-era continuity at Dark Horse. Consequently, there are a number of miniseries--such as Jedi, and Obsession--which are so tightly integrated with the plots here that they were traded in the same volumes as issues of this title.\n\nNumbering in this series continues at Star Wars: Dark Times. The first issue of that series is parenthetically known as Star Wars: Republic #84 in the indicia.\n\nNumber of issues: 45 (COMPLETE!)\nFile formarts: CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eaac5f26c89a44b953de2780a0829da69c2c2d6","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eaac5f26c89a44b953de2780a0829da69c2c2d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,170,197,242,108,137,164,75,149,61,226,120,10,8,41,218,105,194,194,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
