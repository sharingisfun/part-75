How different is the crisis from the rest of the Euro-zone?\nWhat can we learn from this symbolic war between people's determination to preserve common values, human conditions, rights and needs, versus an orwellian financial world?\n\nDebt Management\nAre we really free to choose and is the peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power acknowledged? Ã¢â‚¬Å“Debt ManagementÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a short documentary on the illusion of freedom (the case of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“boiling frogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and the illusion of choice (as in the example of Ã¢â‚¬Å“PlatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s caveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). The Greek crisis is just another round in the constant struggle between those who take decisions that determine the will of whole societies and the real power of the people. How can entire societies become powerless, from an economic point of view? By what means is that being achieved in modern Europe?\n\nBIOGRAPHY\nMy name is Vahagn Karapetyan, I was born in Armenia and came to Greece for studies in 2006.
