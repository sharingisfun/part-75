As with previous editions of this book, Don Gosselin introduces key Web authoring techniques with a strong focus on industry application. A real-world project, similar to what students would encounter in a professional setting, is developed throughout each chapter. Since professional Web development jobs often require programmers to add features to an existing site, each chapter project uses a professionally designed Web site. After completing the course, students will be able to use JavaScript to build professional quality, dynamic Web sites.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ced9a648bd388fed7174845f7227cb0dd2acd74","amp;dn":"avaScript%3A+The+Web+Technologies+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ced9a648bd388fed7174845f7227cb0dd2acd74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,237,154,100,139,211,136,254,215,23,72,69,247,34,124,176,221,42,205,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
