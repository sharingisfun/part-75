Not exactly cinematic brilliance, but enthusiastic performances\nand  plenty of fun, particularly for fans of porn from that era.\n\nFor the unsure there's a preview that runs about four minutes\nand samples several places in the movie.\n\nScreens can be found at http://bayimg.com/DAIamaaEg\nor in the torrent package.\n\nOpening credits, in their entirety, which will give you pretty good idea\nof what's in store:\n\nTitle ....................... All In the Family\nStarring .................... Saul T. Peter\n         .................... Aida Pussee\n  and introducing\n         .................... Lagusta Bendova\n\nProduced and Directed ....... Under the influence of Earnest and Julio *\n\n\n======================================================================\n\nThe original version of this, which you can find here and there on the\nnet, is quite dull and dark.  I did what I could with the color\nwithin the limitations of the original source and the amount of\ntime I have to devote to such things. For the curious, along with\nthe screens image there's one with before-and-afters of the\nsame thumbnails.  The audio had some radical variations in level\nso I did a little to try to even that out.\n\n\nReleased or whatever ........ Probably sometime in the '70s, it doesn't say.\nLanguage ....................
