KnivesÃ¢â‚¬â€perhaps our most important gastronomic toolÃ¢â‚¬â€predate the discovery of fire, whereas the fork endured centuries of ridicule before gaining widespread acceptance; pots and pans have been around for millennia, while plates are a relatively recent invention. Many once-new technologies have become essential elements of any well-stocked kitchenÃ¢â‚¬â€mortars and pestles, serrated knives, stainless steel pots, refrigerators. Others have proved only passing fancies, or were supplanted by better technologies; one would be hard pressed now to find a water-powered egg whisk, a magnet-operated spit roaster, a cider owl, or a turnspit dog. Although many tools have disappeared from the modern kitchen, they have left us with traditions, tastes, and even physical characteristics that we would never have possessed otherwise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77de5d6503950ab51bf5c024b529c12e681911a","amp;dn":"Consider+the+Fork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77de5d6503950ab51bf5c024b529c12e681911a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,125,229,214,80,57,80,171,81,191,92,2,75,82,156,18,230,129,145,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
