The carefree lifestyle of Tony changes dramatically when his convoy is attacked following a weapons test personally overseeing, and he finds himself a prisoner of a group of insurgents. Wounded by shrapnel, who stays near his already weakened heart and endangers his life, Tony is forced to build a devastating weapon for Raza, the mysterious leader of the revolutionaries. Ignoring the demands of his captors, he uses his intellect and ingenuity to create armor to keep it alive and allow him to escape from captivity. Upon his return to America, Tony must confront the reality of his past and decides to take a new direction with Stark Industries. Despite the resistance from Obadiah Stane, his right hand and the company's chief executive, who took over the business in his absence, Tony spends day and night in his studio, perfecting and polishing armor that grants superhuman strength and physical protection. With the help of his lifelong assistant, Pepper Potts, and his trusted military liaison James Rhodes, Tony uncovers a sinister plot with global ramifications.

Banner has been living in the shadows, away from society and the woman he loves, Dr. Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Ross. Subsisting as a fugitive to avoid the obsessive pursuit of which he is subjected by his nemesis, General Thaddeus &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross, he is aware that the military machine that is looking for him to capture him and brutally exploit his power is always on his heels. As all three grapple with the secrets that led to The Hulk's creation, they are confronted with a new and ruthless adversary Abomination, a monstrous being possessing a destructive force that exceeds even The Hulk. And to defeat this villain, the scientist must make a critical decision: accept his peaceful life as Bruce Banner or find heroism in the creature that lives inside.\n\nIRON MAN 2\nThe world knows that billionaire Tony Stark is Iron Man, the masked superhero. Under pressure from the government, the press and the public to share his technology with the military, Tony is unwilling to divulge the secrets of the Iron Man armor because he fears the information will slip into the wrong hands. With Pepper Potts and James &quot;Rhodey&quot; Rhodes at his side, Tony forges alliances and confronts powerful new forces.\n\nTHOR\nThor is a powerful but arrogant warrior whose reckless actions rekindle an old war.
