The long-simmering feud between Ben and his immigrant father Roland threatens to boil over and ruin the 18th birthday party of Ben's sister Rose. But to Ben's surprise, his sister's celebration challenges his sense of misplaced identity, and the way he regards his father and grandfather. In one night, Ben faces the true nature of his relationships with his family, his friends, and himself.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163745/\t\n\nI've added another torrent (this one) due to the other one having just the commentary on the audio of the movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f700b1a10469b935c8912bb92a471e001aee98ac","amp;dn":"The+Debut+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f700b1a10469b935c8912bb92a471e001aee98ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,0,177,161,4,105,185,53,200,145,43,185,42,71,30,0,26,238,152,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
