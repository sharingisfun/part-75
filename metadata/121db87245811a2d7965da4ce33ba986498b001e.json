Powered and enabled by the invention known as the Great Machine, the world's machines have turned on mankind and sparked social unrest, decimating the human population before being largely shut down. But, as our world fell to pieces, a mission began to salvage the legacy of civilization; a group of small creations was given the spark of life by a scientist in the final days of humanity, and they continue to exist post-apocalypse. One of these creations, 9, emerges to display leadership qualities that may help them survive and possibly even thrive. It is only by chance that he discovers a small community of others like himself taking refuge from fearsome machines that roam the earth intent on their extinction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:121db87245811a2d7965da4ce33ba986498b001e","amp;dn":"%279%27+%282009%29+Blu-Ray+1080p+433MB+MovieBill1956+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"121db87245811a2d7965da4ce33ba986498b001e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,29,184,114,69,129,26,45,121,101,218,76,227,59,169,134,73,139,0,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
