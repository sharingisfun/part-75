Geoffrey Norris looks at what really happened on the night of the most famous premiere in musical history, Philip Clark traces how composers have since embraced The Rite's musical innovations, and Sir Simon Rattle and Esa-Pekka Salonen discuss conducting the work.\n\nAlso in this issue, David Vickers talks to John Butt about the Dunedin Consort's new Linn recording of Bach's St John Passion, which aims to reconstruct the complete Good Friday vesper service as it might have been celebrated during Bach's tenure as Thomaskantor. Plus pianist Imogen Cooper reflects on a busy few months of sessions in the recording studio and duetting live with Paul Lewis in the Musician's Diary; the Philharmonia record a Holst Planets for the digital age in our Session Report; and Lindsay Kemp talks to Richard Egarr about Bach's English Suites in The Musician and the Score.\n\nAlso, the monthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new classical music releases are reviewed by our expert critics -- including our Recording of the Month, Bach's St John Passion performed by the Dunedin Consort under John Butt, released on Linn.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50cc1694c285f4d68c0ae81d5d0d986e5d792fac","amp;dn":"Gramophone+magazine+-+March+2013+%5Bclassical+music%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50cc1694c285f4d68c0ae81d5d0d986e5d792fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,204,22,148,194,133,244,214,140,10,232,29,93,13,152,110,93,121,47,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
