We cannot find\nwords to praise Him, AS He only sees fit how laudation should be addressed to\nHim. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils within ourselves and the evils of our\nbad deeds. Whosoever Allah guides will never be led astray, and whosoever He\nleads astray will never find guidance. We bear witness that there is no god but\nAllah, the One without any associate, and We bear witness that Muhammad is\nHis Messenger and bondman, peace and blessings be upon him, his kith and kin,\nhis Companions and all those who follow their guidance until the Day of\nJudgment.\n\n\nAddress: Islamic Applications Collection for iPhone\nLanguage: English\nShort Description: Islamic Applications Collection for iPhone Consists of:\n1- alQuran v1.1\n2- iPray v2.102\n3- iAzkar v2.0\n4- iQuranPro v2.3\n5- iZakah v1.0\n6.
