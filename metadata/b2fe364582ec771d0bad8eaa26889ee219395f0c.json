Are religions or    :\n : tyrants, capitalism or communism the cause of most human suffering? Has    :\n : violence increased or decreased over the course of history? In this wholly :\n : original and remarkably ambitious work, 'Atrocitologist' Matthew White     :\n : considers man's inhumanity to man across several thousand years of history.:\n : From the First Punic War and the collapse of Mayan rule, to the reign of   :\n : Peter the Great and the cataclysmic events of the Second World War, White's:\n : epic book spans centuries and civilizations as it measures the hundred most:\n : violent events in human history. While skeptical of any grand theory for   :\n : the causes of human violence, White does share three big lessons gleaned   :\n : from his careful statistical analysis: one, chaos is more deadly than      :\n : tyranny; two, the world is even more disorganized than we realize; and     :\n : three, wars kill more civilians than soldiers (in fact, the army is usually:\n : the safest place to be). If we study history to avoid the mistakes of the  :\n : past, then there can be no more important place to start than this         :\n : eye-opening and entertaining book.                                         :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2fe364582ec771d0bad8eaa26889ee219395f0c","amp;dn":"Matthew+White+Atrocitology+2011+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2fe364582ec771d0bad8eaa26889ee219395f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,254,54,69,130,236,119,29,11,173,142,170,38,136,158,226,25,57,95,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
