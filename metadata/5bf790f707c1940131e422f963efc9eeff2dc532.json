(Forest Gump)\nDescription:\n\nYahweh the Creator needs NO SPACESHIP or Mechanical device to do what He does. There are 2 types of inter-dimensional travelers. Yahweh, Jesus, The Holy Spirit obviously and the unfallen (HEAVENLY) angels that require nothing mechanical to dimension travel, however, The Fallen Angels seem to have lost some of their power and need artificial means to manipulate the different dimensions. EVERYTHING coming in a spaceship is of Satan not The Holy Yahweh.\n\nSome believe the corruption of antediluvian DNA by Watchers was an effort to cut off the birth line of the Messiah. This theory posits that Satan understood the protoevangeliumÃ¢â‚¬â€the promise in Genesis 3:15 that a Savior would be born, the seed of the woman, and that He would destroy the fallen angelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power. SatanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followers therefore intermingled with the human race in a conspiracy to stop the birth of Christ. If human DNA could be universally corrupted or Ã¢â‚¬Å“demonized,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they reasoned, no Savior would be born and mankind would be lost forever. Those who support this theory believe this is why God ordered His people to maintain a pure bloodline and not to intermarry with the other nations. When Israel breached this command and the mutated DNA began rapidly spreading among men and animals, God instructed Noah to build an ark and to prepare for a flood that would destroy every living thing. That God had to send such a universal fiat like the Flood illustrates how widespread the altered DNA eventually became. In fact, the Bible says in Genesis 6:9 that only Noah, and by extension his children, were found Ã¢â‚¬Å“perfectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in their generation. The Hebrew word for Ã¢â‚¬Å“perfectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in this case is tamiym, which means Ã¢â‚¬Å“without blemishÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“healthy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the same word used in Leviticus to describe an unblemished, sacrificial lamb. The meaning was not that Noah was morally perfect, but that his physical makeupÃ¢â‚¬â€his DNAÃ¢â‚¬â€had not been contaminated with nephilim descent, as apparently the rest of the world had become. In order to preserve mankind as He had made them, God destroyed all but NoahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family in the Flood. The ancient records including those of the Bible appear to agree with this theology, consistently describing the cause of the Flood as happening in response to Ã¢â‚¬Å“all fleshÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ having become Ã¢â‚¬Å“corrupted, both man and beast.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n:thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf790f707c1940131e422f963efc9eeff2dc532","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+End+Times+-+06+-+Revelation+and+The+Rapture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf790f707c1940131e422f963efc9eeff2dc532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,247,144,247,7,193,148,1,49,228,34,249,99,239,201,238,255,45,197,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
