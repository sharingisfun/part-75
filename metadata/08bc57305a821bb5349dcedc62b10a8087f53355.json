Soon after the launch of Scam School, I frequently had requests to teach larger, more complicated tricks and feats on the show. The problem is, Scam School has always been about learning a simple concept that, even after a few beers, you could half-remember the episode and still have a decent chance at pulling it off.  Extra Credit is for those of you who want to give some extra time and effort to practicing a more advanced technique.  While you'll be devoting more time, man is it going to be worth it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if what you've learned on Scam School has scored you a fair share of free cold ones, Extra Credit is going to do you wonders.  Give me $2 and 20 minutes and I'll go through all you need to know for these more advanced routines. \n\n\nIn this premiere lesson, I take you through the steps to pull of the 3 Coin Trick.  You'll learn two advanced, yet easy-to-learn moves that will have you scamming even the most attentive of audiences.  The best part is, the 3 coin trick works with any objects:  bottle caps, paper clips... I've even performed it on the beach using some random rocks I found.  Once you get the simple progression down, you'll have a surefire, solid, adaptable routine that you can do anytime, anywhere.\n\n***Thank you for watching Extra Credit, even if it is a free copy you torrented ;) Ã¢â‚¬Â¦  To directly support this show, please consider purchasing a copy for only $1.99.

Unpaid labor from Brian's own daughter.  Jon?  Well, that's just Jon, but he deserves something, too...  The point is that we're not some mega-corporation that's trying to squeeze blood out of a stone.  We're just Brian and a couple of assistants trying to teach some more advanced tricks than we can get away with on Scam School.  So if Brian ever won you a free drink, why not return the favor by giving him two lousy dollars.  That's *literally* less than the cost of a coke at the airport... and there isn't even any liquor in there.***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08bc57305a821bb5349dcedc62b10a8087f53355","amp;dn":"Scam+Stuff+Extra+Credit+001%3A+3+Coin+Trick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08bc57305a821bb5349dcedc62b10a8087f53355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,188,87,48,90,130,27,181,52,157,206,220,98,177,10,128,135,245,51,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
