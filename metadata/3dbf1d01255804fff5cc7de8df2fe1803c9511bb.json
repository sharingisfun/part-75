Diabla, Diabla\n\nWith every new album, long-running Toronto purveyors of trashy boogie rock White Cowbell Oklahoma tone down their crass and horny shtick and pump up their musicianship and songwriting. Continuing in the vein of 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s psychedelic Bombardero, their newest full-length is without song titles like Put The South In Your Mouth and with plenty of surprises.\nThough the tuneage and vocals have lost some of their unhinged energy, the riffs remain anvil-heavy, the guitar leads harmonized and the cowbell-touched rhythms swaggering. The manly Get Back To The Grove nods to 70s-era Simmons-led KISS, Easy Street coasts along on pumped-up psychedelia, while the retro Flapjack Flytrap is built on a righteous progressive rock foundation and has the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catchiest lyrics.\nBookending the ZZ Toppish offerings are an impressively moody instrumental, Buenas Noches, the Doorsy jam-out StreetknifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Theme (with a left-field and questionable lounge music middle) and long-winded closer Diabla, Diabla, bursting with woozy organs and skronky horns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dbf1d01255804fff5cc7de8df2fe1803c9511bb","amp;dn":"White+Cowbell+Oklahoma+-+Buenas+Nachas+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dbf1d01255804fff5cc7de8df2fe1803c9511bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,191,29,1,37,88,4,255,245,204,125,232,223,47,225,128,60,149,17,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
