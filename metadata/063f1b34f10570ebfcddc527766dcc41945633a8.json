The veteran is searching a medic which can cure his son. Meanwhile they'll have to confront a shepherd family (Dean Jagger and Harry Dean Stanton) and taking on deal of dangers.\n\nIn the film there are glimmer landscapes, familiar drama ,shootouts and agreeable feeling. The movie talks upon typical western old theme: fights between settlers and cattlemen. The final showdown amongst the protagonists and enemies is exciting. Runtime film is adjusted, one hour and half approx. ,it is neither dreary , nor tiring but enjoyable.\n\nAlan Ladd interpretation is top notch likeness his son David Ladd (future marriage to Cheryl Ladd and father of Jordan Ladd). Support cast is awesome, as Dean Jagger and Harry Dean Stanton(Paris, Texas), outstanding actor with a long career that today continues. Olivia De Havilland is enticing, gentle and sweet. Ted Mc Cord cinematography is riveting and glamorous . Jerome Moross musical score is fascinating, similar to soundtrack that he made in Ã‚Â¨Big countryÃ‚Â¨ deemed the best western score along with Ã‚Â¨ The seven magnificentÃ‚Â¨. The yarn will appeal to western buffs and sentimental argument lovers. Rating : Good. Well catching","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:063f1b34f10570ebfcddc527766dcc41945633a8","amp;dn":"Proud+Rebel+%28Western%29+%7BAlan+Ladd%7D+%5B1958%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"063f1b34f10570ebfcddc527766dcc41945633a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,63,27,52,241,5,112,235,252,221,197,39,118,109,204,65,148,86,51,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
