Unfold\n\nAbout The Lost Satellites from the band's website:\n\nThe sound is a colorful mix of songwriting and lyricism continuing the traditions of 60's rock and 80's and 90's grunge and alt rock, blanketed with contemporary indie style and attitude. Openly introspective, often provacotive, a bit irreverent, loads of fun, certainly post modern...In a medium where image has become more important than integrity, The Lost Satellites are staying focused on the music and true to the art.\n\nThe War Will End is the second album from The Lost Satellites. It was tracked and mixed in Richmond, VA at Sound of Music by co-producer Al Weatherhead (Sparklehorse, Camper Von Beethoven, Cracker). Written and co-produced by Frank Scott, the album features the core ensemble with Mark Henderson, Tina Marie, and Sammy Giacco, as well as many guest performances.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64232e2bdb6314682a062c46827b51eafdec16d1","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Satellites+-+The+War+Will+End+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64232e2bdb6314682a062c46827b51eafdec16d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,35,46,43,219,99,20,104,42,6,44,70,130,123,81,234,253,236,22,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
