He entered music school at age seven, and resisted classical training in favor of jazz, inspired early on by Dave Brubeck, Ramsey Lewis, Art Blakey, and Horace Silver.  He first met Wynton Marsalis at age 17, and toured briefly with the trumpeter the following year (his first and only at Cal State-Northridge). In 1989, Reed officially joined Marsalis' band as the replacement for Marcus Roberts.\n\nHere (Live 2006)\nManhatan Melodies (1999)\nPure Imagination (1998)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48b75b61f57e4599f096f5f8f008dbe647d58b70","amp;dn":"Eric+Reed+-+3+Cd%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48b75b61f57e4599f096f5f8f008dbe647d58b70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,183,91,97,245,126,69,153,240,150,245,248,240,8,219,230,71,213,139,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
