Claudio Filippini has grown to be considered one of the most promising artists in the Italian jazz scene today thanks to his numerous awards and international collaborations. 'Facing North' is a convergence of two worlds and approaches, where the pianist meets two extraordinary musicians such as Palle Danielsson and Olavi Louhivuori. The former is a true legend of Northern European jazz, an amazing bass player who shaped a movement that honors him today as one of its greatest leaders. The latter, drummer Olavi Louhivuori, is among the leading protagonists in Finnish jazz despite his young age, and is a cohort of Tomasz Stanko and Dave Stapleton amongst many others. From this meeting comes a thrilling album, where northern European influences mix with Filippini s lyricism. An extraordinary writing from which compositions of great depth are born, giving due recognition to Filippini not only as a musician but also as a composer. A perfect symbiosis between the three musicians who, from the very first recorded note, seem to have known each other forever.
