Somerset Maugham), telling the story \nof his life in 82 chapters. It &quot;summed up the literary, social and moral history of the \ncentury with comic richness as well as encyclopedic knowingness&quot;, according to Malcolm Bradbury. In an October 2006 poll in The Observer, it was named joint third for the best work of British and Commonwealth fiction of the last 25 years (along with Ian McEwan's Atonement, Penelope Fitzgerald's The Blue Flower, Kazuo Ishiguro's The Unconsoled, and Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children).\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this torrent, please return the favor and seed for as long as you can!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e22aeaec6625b62a6305dc62ee42e99756c819","amp;dn":"%5BREQ%5D+Anthony+Burgess+-+Earthly+Powers+%5BEPUB-MOBI-PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8e22aeaec6625b62a6305dc62ee42e99756c819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,226,42,234,236,102,37,182,42,99,5,220,98,238,66,233,151,86,200,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
