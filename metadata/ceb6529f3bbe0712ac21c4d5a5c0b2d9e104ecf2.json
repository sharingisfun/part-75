So at the age of twelve, Burroughs found himself amidst Victorian squalor living with the doctor's bizarre family, and befriending a paedophile who resided in the backyard shed. The story of an outlaw childhood where rules were unheard of, and the Christmas tree stayed up all year round, where Valium was consumed like candy, and if things got dull an electroshock-therapy machine could provide entertainment. The funny, harrowing and bestselling account of an ordinary boy's survival under the most extraordinary circumstances.\n\nEPUB and MOBI formats are provided.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed so that others may also enjoy this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceb6529f3bbe0712ac21c4d5a5c0b2d9e104ecf2","amp;dn":"Running+With+Scissors+-+Augusten+Burroughs+EPUB+and+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceb6529f3bbe0712ac21c4d5a5c0b2d9e104ecf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,182,82,159,59,190,7,18,172,33,196,213,165,192,178,217,225,4,236,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
