Skippers website &quot;Mars Anomaly Research&quot;, downloaded with wget in December 2012.\n\nSkipper's website is offline since a few weeks ago.\n\n\nTechnical data\n--------------\n\nArchive format:  ZIP\nLanguage:        English\nFile size:       113,8 MB\n\nThe mirror is nearly complete, just some images loaded via JavaScript are missing. These images are for navigation purposes, they are not part of the content.\n\n\nShort description\n-----------------\n\n&quot;Mars Anomaly Research&quot; was a great NASA-Space-Extraterrestial-Life-Government-Conspiracy-Site, which gave evidence that\n\n- so-called &quot;scientific&quot; images from Space exploration are manipulated.\n- there is liquid water on Mars.\n- there is life on Mars.\n- there are artefacts of former civilizations on the martian surface.\n- there are artefacts of former civilizations on the lunar surface.\n- there are strange things in Space.\n\nIt is not an &quot;UFO-site&quot;. All evidence is taken from the NASA internet publications and referenced, so it can be compared with the original material and verified.  \n\nSometimes images are overinterpreted by Skipper, in one case he described a large martian city in JPEG artifacts of a press release photo, and sometimes he found really weird stuff. It\n\nIn my opinion, Skipper should be awarded with &quot;The Great Rorschach Award&quot;. But it is a great and unique conspiracy site worth to be conserved. Even for non-believers (like me) it is an insight in the conspiracy theorist way of thinking. \n\nIf you like this kind of stuff, download it and SEED it.
