While the studio recordings are more famous, some may find these 1940-42 broadcasts more compelling. Although thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fair amount of crackle present from the original acetates, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a bit of crackle in the band as well, who seem invigorated by the live setting and provide the music with a little more punch than there was in the studio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e4cd624093f83453e7d006ab79b982c9fcd870a","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+Young+Blue+Eyes%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e4cd624093f83453e7d006ab79b982c9fcd870a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,76,214,36,9,63,131,69,62,125,0,106,183,155,152,44,159,205,135,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
