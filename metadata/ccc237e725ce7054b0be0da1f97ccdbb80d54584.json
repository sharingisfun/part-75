She can finally put her high school days as the geeky-girl-with-flop-sweats behind her; sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s graduated from medical school and is now a first-year intern at Denver Memorial Hospital, where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have the chance to work with world-famous cardiologist Dr. Gina Beckett Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and where, not-so-coincidentally, her med-school crush Will Rider is also an intern. So why does everyone keep warning her that the hospital is just like high school? Emily soon finds out the hard way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ her high school nemesis, the gorgeous, popular Cassandra Kopelson, is also just starting out at Denver Memorial, and it seems like theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re rivals all over again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not only as surgical interns, but for WillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention. Fellow intern Tyra Granger warns Emily that the cliques at Denver Memorial are all too familiar: the jocks have become orthopedic surgeons; the mean girls are in plastics; the rebels are in the ER, and Tyra has her own Awkward place as the principalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kid Ã¢â‚¬â€œ her father is the chief resident. EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the new kid all over again, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just as Awkward as high school. Only this time around, Emily will have to balance the personal and emotional turmoil of social politics with the high-stakes world of life-and-death medical decisions. At least she has fellow intern Tyra and nerdy-but-cute resident Micah, to count on as friends. Emily is growing to realize that although she may be a geek, she may also grow to be a great doctor, flop sweats and all.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccc237e725ce7054b0be0da1f97ccdbb80d54584","amp;dn":"Emily.Owens.M.D.S01E11.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccc237e725ce7054b0be0da1f97ccdbb80d54584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,194,55,231,37,206,112,84,176,190,13,161,249,124,205,187,128,213,69,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
