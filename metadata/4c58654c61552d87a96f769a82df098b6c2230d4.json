Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he\n   is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life.\n   Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast.\n\n\n1.Copy all files from Update folder to game directory\n2.Play\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c58654c61552d87a96f769a82df098b6c2230d4","amp;dn":"DmC+Devil+may+Cry+Update+1-CRACKED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c58654c61552d87a96f769a82df098b6c2230d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,88,101,76,97,85,45,135,169,111,118,154,130,223,9,139,108,34,48,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
