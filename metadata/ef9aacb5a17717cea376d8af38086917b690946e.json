We ended looking at Jesus and were reminded that we are crucified with Christ (Galatians 2:20) and that our call is to daily take up our cross and follow Him (Mark 8:34; cf. Luke 9:23).\n\nAthey Creek Christian Fellowship is a body of believers in Wilsonville Oregon desiring to know the Lord in an ever-increasing measure.
