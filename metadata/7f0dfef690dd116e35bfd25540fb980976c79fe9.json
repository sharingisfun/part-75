PROTECTION: Steam\n1: DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE: Action\n\n******************************\n**     **Game Notes:**        **\n ****************************** \nBrutal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat\nwith open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the\nRings and Spinal Tap, its a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which\nin this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving\nhumanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor\nand musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by\nsome of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of\nthe beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike\n\nIncluded as a free bonus in the PC version of Brutal Legend are both the\nHammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs\n\nChange log:-\n----------\n\nMajor Fixes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Terrible stuttering/low framerate that some players experienced after pausing the game (including opening the map) should now be now fixed.
