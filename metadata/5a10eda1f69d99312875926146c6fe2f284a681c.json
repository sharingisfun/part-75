It follows the epic journeys of a young woods guide named Richard Cypher (Craig Horner), a mysterious woman named Kahlan Amnell (Bridget Regan), a wizard named Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander (Bruce Spence), and a warrior named Cara (Tabrett Bethell) as they defend against tyranny and destruction. The story depicted in the television series substantially differs from that as portrayed in the written series.\n\nThis torrent includes the entire series converted (by me) to iPod/Pad format (.m4v) with all the tags, etc. that would come with a proper, online-bought copy.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_seeker&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_seeker&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a10eda1f69d99312875926146c6fe2f284a681c","amp;dn":"Legend+of+the+Seeker+%28Complete+Series%29+iPod%2FiPaD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a10eda1f69d99312875926146c6fe2f284a681c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,16,237,161,246,157,153,49,40,117,146,97,70,198,254,47,40,74,104,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
