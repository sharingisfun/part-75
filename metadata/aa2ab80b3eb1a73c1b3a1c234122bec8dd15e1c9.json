General Herman and Brigadier Betty of the Western Frontier are on garrison duty in the Solar Empire when the Anglos strike, and assist Empress Lei-Qo and Admiral A-Qira in repelling the invaders. But as the nations of the world, including the Tundran Territories, are once again propelled into all-out conflict, it becomes clear that a shadowy figure is pulling the strings from afar. Can it be that the power-hungry Kaiser Vlad of Xylvania has returned? And what does this have to do with the centuries-old conflict between the Iron Legion and the Solar Empire?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa2ab80b3eb1a73c1b3a1c234122bec8dd15e1c9","amp;dn":"RBWP01+-+Battalion+Wars+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa2ab80b3eb1a73c1b3a1c234122bec8dd15e1c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,42,184,11,62,177,167,60,27,58,28,35,65,34,190,200,221,21,225,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
