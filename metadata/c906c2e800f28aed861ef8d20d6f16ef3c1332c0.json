Two brothers              \n        Demetrius Meech Flenory and Terry Southwest T Flenory      \n        ran a drug enterprise that had 200 members and was             \n        connected to one of the major Mexican cartels. In the Hip-     \n        Hop music industry they created a front company called BMF     \n        Entertainment, which was a perfect mix of drugs, violence,     \n        and street cred that makes their story Hip-Hops version       \n        of the Godfather.                                              \n                                                                       \n        BMF is a 80-minute documentary that explores the story of      \n        the 15-year investigation by the DEA, FBI and an elite         \n        drug task force called HIDTA that resulted in 41               \n        defendants across the country being charged in one of the      \n        largest drug conspiracy cases ever. The film is a tale         \n        that combines the story of a criminal syndicate that lived     \n        on a code of honor and conduct that rivaled any of the         \n        five Mafia families, and ended just as dramatically under      \n        a hailstorm of government informants, wiretaps and             \n        surveillance that ultimately caused the downfall of the        \n        Hip-Hop Drug Empire.                                           \n                                                                       \n        With over 11,000 government documents and close to 5,000       \n        photographs and taped conversations the BMF is a               \n        documentary that will deconstruct the story of BMF from        \n        both the law enforcement angle and from members inside BMF     \n        that had intimate knowledge of the operation. The film         \n        will include interviews with: informants, DEA Agents,          \n        District Attorneys, FBI, Atlanta Police and rare insights     \n        from Hip-Hop heavyweights, Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane, Rick       \n        Ross, Fabolous, and many others. While many articles have      \n        been written in the press about BMF, BMF is a film on two      \n        brothers that were able to fuse an organized crime network,    \n        with a company that purveyed Hip-Hop hype, the ultimate        \n        gangster tale.                                                 \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n        We're back!
