Video/Audio are untouched. There is absolutely no point to reencode\nas the source is progressive and the file sizes are very &quot;affordable&quot;. That's also the \nreason for H264 tag and not x264. \n\n\nThe Good: Most of TV shows never see a Blu-Ray release. This is the closest thing\n          you'd get to a retail HD release. HDTV 720p caps are not regularly archived on many \n          sites and they have the all &quot;issues&quot; of a TV cap - screen spam from network, occasional\n          issues such as airing compression artifacts, encode filtering issues, no end credits\n          and so on. \n\nThe Bad: 1) Go prove you didn't just leech it off a Pee2Pee and scene'd it.\n         2) No rules\n         3) No site sections\n         4) Low tradability.\n\nBest way we thought of to work around &quot;The Bad 1)&quot; is a screenshot of our iTunes queue as it's downloading\nthe set. Seems like a decent proof we spent our hard earned money on the atrocity that is iTunes, fruit of \nthe devil's spawn (aka crApple).\n\nWhy bother? Everyone likes high res and so do we. We are aiming at shows we like and don't \nhave high res copies of. In this instance, both seasons of Carnivale never had 720p caps\nin the english scene and unlikely to ever see a Blu-Ray release. \n\nWe ripped the CC that come with the iTunes vid but they turned out to be shit, so we used our NTSC \ncopy. There are 3 options: 1) Closed Captions processed to lower case (with upper case at the beginning\nof sentences, sadly it also does it for names but we find upper case very annoying). 2) lower case \noriginal (upper case for all dialogs and lower case for captions) 3) Vobsubs. \n\n\n\n&quot;After the ball is over,\nAfter the break of morn \nAfter the dancers' leaving;\nAfter the stars are gone;\nMany a heart is aching,\nIf you could read them all;\nMany the hopes that have vanished\nAfter the ball.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5e4857b3be6193bd440a4ba96853a3ff6953f9f","amp;dn":"Carnivale.S02E12.720p.WEBRip.H264-DRAWER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5e4857b3be6193bd440a4ba96853a3ff6953f9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,228,133,123,59,230,25,59,212,64,164,186,150,133,58,63,246,149,63,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
