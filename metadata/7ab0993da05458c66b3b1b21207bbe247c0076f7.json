Check out the LOG file to get more technical info.\n\nIn the original DVD there were lots of soundtracks with dubbed sound. If you prefer the voice of your local B-actor over Robin Williams and Robert deNiro, this is not something for you.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab0993da05458c66b3b1b21207bbe247c0076f7","amp;dn":"Awakenings+--+with+20+subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab0993da05458c66b3b1b21207bbe247c0076f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,176,153,61,160,84,88,198,107,59,27,33,32,123,190,36,124,0,118,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
