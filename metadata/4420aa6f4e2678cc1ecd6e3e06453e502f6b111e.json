Bang Gang's sound proved to be as enigmatic as its helmsman, fusing together Montt MardiÃƒÂ©-esque falsetto-driven indie pop and atmospheric, Portishead-like electronica. JÃƒÂ³hannsson is often joined by vocalists Esther Talia Casey, M83's Anthony Gonzalez, and Keren Ann on his Bang Gang recordings; Keren Ann and JÃƒÂ³hannsson also work together as Lady &amp; Bird. Bang Gang had its big break while performing at the Midem Festival, where the project caught the attention of a rep from East-West France with the song &quot;Sleep.&quot; JÃƒÂ³hannsson was hustled into the studio and his first single, &quot;So Alone?,&quot; was released in the summer of 1999. The single was a hit on the Icelandic charts, and the song's popularity on Icelandic radio launched it into rotation on MTV Europe. Bang Gang's debut album, You, was released one year later. JÃƒÂ³hannsson spent the next two years working on various projects; in addition to recording more Bang Gang material, he also wrote and produced songs for other artists and developed a TV show for the Screen One channel. Bang Gang's second album, Something Wrong, hit stores in 2003. Bang Gang moved to Cod Records for its third full-length, Ghosts from the Past, which was released in France in \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n\nGhosts From The Past (2008)     Audiochecker: 100.00% CDDA\n\n\n01.The World Is Gray\n02.One More Trip\n03.I Know You Sleep\n04.Black Parade\n05.Lost In Wonderland\n06.Every Time I Look In Your Eyes\n07.Ghost From The Past\n08.Forever Now\n09.Don't Feel Ashamed\n10.You Won't Get Out\n11.Stay Home\n\n\nI Like To Move It (2001)     Audiochecker: 99.83% CDDA\n\n\n01.I Like To Move It (Jens O.
