Both of their albums have received pretty decent reviews from pitchfork; why are they are so 'under the radar' is a mystery to me. They have a new one finished, but the release date is not yet set.\n\nThis torrent includes both of their studio albums at 256k MP3. I personally have purchased both of their albums, and when they start touring again, I'm going to go out and support them.\n\nFight for your indie bands!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b73c013eb16870307625990f63adf2451973a1b","amp;dn":"Uncut+%28Canadian+Indie+Band%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b73c013eb16870307625990f63adf2451973a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,115,192,19,235,22,135,3,7,98,89,144,246,58,223,36,81,151,58,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
