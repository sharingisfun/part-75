Cholly is a gaunt Road-Warrioresque adventurer. Flytrap is his sumo-like (and naked!) companion. Together, they travel a post-apocalyptic world reminiscent of the wild west. \n\nThis torrent contains: the 'Original Adventures', culled from the 'Epic Magazine' by Marvel and collected as a TPB; the four-issue mini, 'The New Adventures of...' published under the epic Comics line; and the four-issue mini 'Cholly and Flytrap' published by Image in 2004.\n\nMuch love to the creative team and scanners. Get it, seed it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f50a2cd6c2e344649c0dc43ec8550ccefb5e7e0","amp;dn":"Cholly+and+Flytrap+%28epic+Comics+%26amp%3B+Image%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f50a2cd6c2e344649c0dc43ec8550ccefb5e7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,80,162,205,108,46,52,70,73,192,220,67,236,133,80,204,239,181,231,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
