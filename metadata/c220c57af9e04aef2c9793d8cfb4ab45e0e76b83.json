This is my very first torrent with my collection of books which I have been collecting for a few years now. I actually have more than 120 GB of books, just they have not been added/sorted on books list nor contained within this torrent. I also download more books as I am writing this description. I will seed this torrent as long as I can, I will not stop seeding it! Plenty of copyrighted books are within this torrent, many of which I have been shared across The Web - mainly on Scribd and 4Shared, but my Scribd/4Shared accountS have been deleted due to that copyright...\n\n2. Now, in order to describe all the books I have in here, I will say that I literally have books from ALL branches of human knowledge: [b][u]occultism, cooking, architecture, numerous encyclopedias, theology, christianity, buddhism, islam, education-related, military-related, paranormal, arabic, astrology, art-related, history, html, web design, computers, drawing, languages, geography, geology, graphics, hacking, hinduism, internet, religions, robotics, sex, self-development, windows[/u][/b] and MANY others! If you do not believe me, then just take a look on the list...\n\n3. Share this torrent wherever you can on The Web, but please keep this description and my email with it. I will upload new torrents every year with whole new books, but it is important that you KEEP this description and my email in case that this torrent be deleted by those who do not want file sharing... Therefore, if this torrent is deleted, but you somehow have my email address and you need some books, please let me know.\n\n4. Instead of giving you ONE COMPLETE torrent, I am giving you torrents with alphabetical listing of books, so that you can download according to your wish.\n\nMy email is: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a4d0ccc1ddc5caca8ad4c1cad0c5c3d6c5c9e4c3c9c5cdc88ac7cbc9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIf you have any thing to say regarding this torrent or books, do it in comments.
