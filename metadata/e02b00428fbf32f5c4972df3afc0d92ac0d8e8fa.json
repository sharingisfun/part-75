And even people averse to contemporary &quot;avant-garde&quot; music might find in Beefheart a continuation of traditions they loved and a sensibility refreshingly healthy in these days, when so many experimental artists feel compelled to shroud their innovations in manifestations of madness and destruction.\n\nBeefheart may be verbally obtuse and look like a trasher of everything &quot;beautiful&quot; (or euphonious) in centuries of Western musical tradition, but what he's really doing, along with people like Cecil Taylor and Albert Ayler and the early Velvet Underground and the Tony Williams Lifetime, is creating a whole new musical vocabulary out of the ashes and dead air left by a crumbling empire of exhausted styles. Instead of destroying, Cap is taking forms with no seeming mileage left and reworking them into prophesies of tomorrow which will be as far-reaching for rock and the new free post-idiomatic music as Ornette Coleman's radical divergence was for jazz a decade ago.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e02b00428fbf32f5c4972df3afc0d92ac0d8e8fa","amp;dn":"Captain+Beefheart+%26amp%3B+His+Magic+Band+-+Lick+My+Decals+Off%2C+Bab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e02b00428fbf32f5c4972df3afc0d92ac0d8e8fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,43,0,66,143,191,50,245,196,151,45,243,175,192,217,42,192,216,232,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
