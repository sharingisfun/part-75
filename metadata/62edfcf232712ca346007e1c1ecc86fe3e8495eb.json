He was re-ordained in the Theravada tradition in Thailand three years later. After that he spent about ten years living the solitary lifestyle in quiet places. He has written numerous booklets and articles on Buddhism, e.g. &quot;Return to the Original Buddha Teachings&quot;, &quot;Message of the Buddha&quot;, &quot;Buddhist Monk's Precepts&quot;, etc.\n\nin 1998, through donations from his supporters, he founded a 15 acre forest monastery, Vihada Buddha Gotama, just outside the town of Temoh, near Kampar, in the state of Perak. The monastery is mainly for the study of the Suttas (discourses) and Vinaya (monastic discipline), and the practice of meditation, according to the original teachings of the Buddha. It is open to monks and nuns (marchees or anagarinis), and also laymen and laywomen.\n\nIn 1999, a Sangha Foundation was registered with the following objectives:\n(a) To foster the teaching, practice and understanding of the Buddha-dhamma - i.e. the teaching of the Buddha, with special emphasis on the Theravada tradition - for the Buddhist Community.\n(b) To participate in social and welfare activities for the benefit of mankind.\n(c) To do all such acts and things as are in the opinion of the Foundation necessary for the attainment of the aforesaid objectives.\n\nTopics in the mp3:\n\nWhat the Buddha taught\nDana and Sila\nKamma Vipaka\nWorldly Currency Vs Spiritual Currency\nPracticality of the Dhamma\nEarly Buddhism in India\nLife Story of the Buddha\nStrive, Not Pray\nLife's Spiritual Lessons\nAppreciation of Parents' Love\nCompassion\nMisconceptions about Buddhism\n8 Worldly Conditions &amp; Clearing Doubts\nLay Buddhist Practice\nImportance of the Buddha's Discourses\n30 Planes of Existence\nMangala Sutta\nRelationship between Buddhist Laity and Sangha\nDhamma Discussion at Kedah Buddhist Association\nContradictions in Buddhism\nKamma and Meat Eating\nChinese Tradition and Buddhism\nRight View (Singapore)\nFour Ariyan Truths\nStream-entry is by Listening to Dhamma\nFive Aggregates of Attachment\nHow to Become an Ariya\nNoble Eightfold Path\nDependent Origination\nDependent Origination of Liberation\nDhamma Discussion at Kajang\nVijja Carana Sampanno\nSatipatthana\nDhamma Discussion on Sakkaya Ditthi, etc\nDhamma Discussion at Kuching\nBuddhist Meditation\nMeditation on Self\nSati Sampajanna\nSamatha and Vipassana\nOne Day Retreat Talks\nBanner of the Arahants\nGeneral Mindfulness the Buddha taught not","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62edfcf232712ca346007e1c1ecc86fe3e8495eb","amp;dn":"English+Buddhist+Dhamma+Talks+by+Dhammavuddho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62edfcf232712ca346007e1c1ecc86fe3e8495eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,237,252,242,50,113,44,163,70,0,126,28,30,204,134,254,62,132,149,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
